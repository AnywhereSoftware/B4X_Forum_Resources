Today I learned a new thing. Besides I2C there is also I3C which has different key features than I2C but can operate at a legacy mode also. I am under the impression that it is a fairly new thing but please correct me if I am wrong. That is because the video by Microchip technology was published at the end of October of 2023. I am sure there will be libraries for it in Arduino if there are not already but it will be great if we have also a B4R library for it. So it is also a wish this post.
