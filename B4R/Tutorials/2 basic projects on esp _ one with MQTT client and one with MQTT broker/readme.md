it is just 2 basic projects to do some tests with MQTT  
we have no personal data in projects, full provisioning is done by a Web server interface  
  
 one basic project is with Wifi and MQTT client  
 Wifi and MQTT are configured by interface of a web server  
 data are stored in eeprom, with management of errors (no data, more data than needed)  
 Wifi and MQTT client will restart automatically in case of network issue   
  
one basic project with Wifi only and a MQTT broker   
 Wifi is configured by interface of a web server  
 data are stored in eeprom, with management of errors (no data, more data than needed)  
 Wifi and MQTT broker will restart automatically in case of network issue   
  
if you install one or more projects MQTT client and one MQTT broker, you can do MQTT testing in your network.
