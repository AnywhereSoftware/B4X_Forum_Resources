arduino-cli interface [for the new B4R version](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4r-v4-00-beta.149706) can be adjusted by a [configuration file](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.33/configuration/#configuration-file), where i could setup at least the EN language - create the file "C:\Program Files\Arduino CLI\arduino-cli.yaml" (in the folder where CLI was installed) with undocumented setting:  
  
> locale: en

  
Also this config file may be at   
> "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.arduinoIDE\arduino-cli.yaml"
