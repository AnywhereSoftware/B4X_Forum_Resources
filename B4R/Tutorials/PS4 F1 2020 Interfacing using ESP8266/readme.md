Hi Guys,  
  
My wife's eldest son is addicted to PS4 F1 2020 game, even bought himself a Rig for a Steering Wheel and Pedals.  
He works alongside with me and on one of our lunch breaks, he mentioned an add-on display for his steering wheel, that would need some re-working of his existing steering wheel, and costed about 150$.

So, after a quick search for this subject in the forum, I came across an OLD [USER=42649]@DonManfred[/USER] thread about this exact theme, I was sure it could be done, but had no clue where to start…  
  
So I started [this Chit-Chat Thread](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/interfacing-the-ps4-console-not-the-controller.127029/) and soon came the firsts progress…  
  
Sooooo….  
  
This thread is to be a Journal of my "journey" into creating a "**PS4 F1 2020 Telemetry Steering Wheel Display**"  
  
The goal will be something that optfully will look somewhat like…

This Journal will be made of 5 parts:  
  
1- Introduction of the project (This Post)  
2 - Code development  
3 - Electronics  
4 - Graphics  
5 - Putting all Together… maybe even creating a Franken-Steering-Wheel using 3D printed parts.  
  
This Project is now a team effort:
