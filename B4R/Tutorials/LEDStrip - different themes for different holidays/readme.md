Here is this RGB Led Strip light project I have been playing around with.  
  
I am including the Android program I use to play with colors.  
  
NOTE when using the Android program you can select a theme and over-ride the theme selected by the B4R program.  
Theme "Normal" hasn't been worked out yet. still working / playing with trying to make something like a fireworks display (the New Years - Fast display is an example)  
  
  
Another NOTE: This uses the changes to the Time Library I made: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/timetools-library-with-ntp-time.101149/#post-702261> which gives me the Number of days in the month. Currently only using them for Memorial Day checking so you can over-ride this in the program by just passing 31 and not applying my changes if you want  
  
  
Enjoy and Happy New Year to ALL

I know pretty lame (the last few seconds is the real Fireworks part). Will keep working on it.  
I saw something where someone said to use Toilet Paper to defuse the light but they didn't say new or used, so I skipped it.
