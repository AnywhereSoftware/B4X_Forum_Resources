Based on [SSD1306 module](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/ssd1306-module.127874/#post-803971), we can display animated images the same as displaying animated GIF on PC. The animated image is a byte array contains (n) number of frames(bitmap images) they all have the same size. the function displays these frames one after another so we see them animated.   
Please note that this function displays the animated image one time, so if we want to repeat it n times or forever we have to use timer.   
  
this code example display 19x16 animated bluetooth image at 109,34 with 100ms interval between frames with no bit inversion.  

```B4X
