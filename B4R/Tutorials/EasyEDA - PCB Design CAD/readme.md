The best part for the ones that have crabs in their pockets is that it allows you to create the PCBs in JLCPCB which company's prices are 13-15 times lower than the Greek companies' prices that create PCBs. You also get cloud (at [www.easyeda.com](http://www.easyeda.com)) which is not necessarily a good thing though… You can download it at: <https://easyeda.com/page/download>
