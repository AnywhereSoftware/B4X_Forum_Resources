Hello,  
  
Since a while i searched to do the same thing i did on an ESP01, but with B4R.  
I did it 1st time in Arduino IDE o\_O, see the video at bottom, that works well :)  
  
I searched long time to see for a library, code, an example in B4R to parse the Json, but no luck :(.  
I read i was not the alone, several time, who search a solution.  
So, as i didn't found anything i have do it in Inline C code.  
Attached the source code, i hope that'll be helpful.  
  
I have put many comments in the source, i also put a Region with all informations to do the setup to run the example. Read it.  
You need to have ArduinoJson library in your own Arduino lib folder.  
I'm not a gourou in C, C++, so, i think many of us will can improve it, use it to do many things.  
Enjoy !  
  
Of course for the example you need to have Domoticz who running to interact with.  
But it's a good starting to get many things other on this base.  
I continue to work to do the same on different weather servers on the web.  
Also i'll try to implement other devices from Domoticz, at this time it's a Temperature/Humidity device.  
  
If i can i'll do a library, but i catched a big headhache already :D  
If you have questions, don't hesitate.
