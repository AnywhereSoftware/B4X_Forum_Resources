Hi guys,  
  
So B4R is so much more than simply code and breakout boards assembled/connecter by jump-wires and breadboards…  
I know for a fact that most of us are not electronics pronned and thus, try to stick to "out of the box"products, but there are very interesting simple circuits that we can use and turn a simple idea into something more usefull and practical.  
  
This is one of those circuits.  
The creator named it "[SIZE=4]Latch Circuit - Wake up + 0 Power Consumption (useful circuit)" but for us is so much more…  
this simple circuit can wake-up our micro-controller and after we are done doing whatever we need to do, just set a digital pin to high to turn the cirtuit COMPLETLY OFF! NO DEEP SLEEP!
