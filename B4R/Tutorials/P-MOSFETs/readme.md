Today I was impressed. While being at the university, some 20 years ago I 've had a hard time understanding the principles of Transistors and MOSFETs. That was partly because I was starting reading 1 or 2 weeks before the exams and just taking notes during the semester, and partly because I was not lucky enough with the professor that had taken on to teach my class (don't ask but if you do he was a syndicalist and he was splitting the time of the lesson by 70% for syndicalism and by 30% for the lesson which was performed on fast forward). Today creating something I needed a P-MOSFET and not being able as it was proved at last, since in the beginning I thought did not know (and indeed you know only what you can remember), not being able thus to recall the exact knowledge for this and not wanting to go through a lot of YT Videos to get what I want, I asked ChatGPT for this. Here is the dialog and it rings a lot of bells (maybe almost 100% right if I recall correctly now but will check it). If anyone wants to step in to verify the info, please don't be shy… :) Step in anytime you want…

> A P-MOSFET (P-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a type of MOSFET where the majority charge carriers are holes. It is constructed using a p-type substrate, which is typically made of silicon. The operation of a P-MOSFET is controlled by applying a positive voltage on the gate terminal to create a depletion region and control the flow of holes between the source and drain terminals.  
>   
> P-MOSFETs are commonly used in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, where they work in conjunction with N-MOSFETs to create logic gates and other digital circuitry.

> So the conduction is only from Drain to Source or can it be also from source to drain if the mosfet is on?  
> ASSISTANT  
> In a P-MOSFET, the conduction occurs from the source to the drain when the transistor is in the on-state. When a positive voltage is applied to the gate terminal, it creates a depletion region in the p-type substrate, allowing the flow of holes from the source to the drain. This is referred to as the active mode or the on-state of the P-MOSFET.  
>   
> In the off-state, when the gate voltage is low or zero, the depletion region expands, blocking the flow of holes between the source and drain. In this state, the P-MOSFET acts as an open circuit, preventing current flow.  
>   
> USER  
> If I set the source in a higher voltage than the drain will there be conduction from source to drain?  
>   
> ASSISTANT  
> No, in a P-MOSFET, the conduction will not occur from the source to the drain if the source voltage is higher than the drain voltage, even if the transistor is in the on-state.  
>   
> In a P-MOSFET, the flow of current (conduction) occurs when there is a positive voltage applied to the gate terminal relative to the source. This creates a depletion region in the substrate, allowing the flow of holes from the source to the drain.  
>   
> If the source voltage is higher than the drain voltage, there will be a reverse bias across the P-N junction between the drain and the substrate, which prevents current flow from the source to the drain. The P-MOSFET will effectively be in the off-state, and the conduction will only occur from the drain to the source when the proper gate voltage is applied.
