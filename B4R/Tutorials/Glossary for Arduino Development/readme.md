### Glossary for Arduino Development by aeric

[B4X Forum - B4R - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/139629/)

This is not a tutorial for B4R. I think a glossary of terms might be useful for beginners to electronics and B4R. So I created my own list in GitHub to record the terms that I find need explanation.   
If this is not appropriate in this section, please move or delete it. Thanks.
