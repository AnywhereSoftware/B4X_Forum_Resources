Received it today (24vdc input) and using it to control banks of short and medium wave infrared lights to dry print on flexo graphic printing machines using water based inks (previously solvent based inks) at speed of 150m/min to print on LDPE, PET, BOPP, OPA, etc. Very very challenging to do water based inks than with solvent based inks. Will post some pics when done. MINI has been programmed with inputs from machine (such as speed) but maintenance to complete balance of electrical installation. Will in the end contol 9000W of IR lamps that will be switched on/off based on speed of of the machine.
