Here is a very interesting video by the guy in Dronebot Workshop. This board seems amazing. I suppose since it is Arduino compatible it can also work with B4R with the exception of the commands:  
1) analogReadResolution(x) x between 1 and 12  
2) analogWriteResolution(x) x between 1 and 10  
  
A good thing also in this board is that it has an analog output pin which is definitive and not PWM.
