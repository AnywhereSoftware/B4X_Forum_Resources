This small sketch shows how to handle pushbutton debouncing and automatic repetition.  
It's a full working example of one button handling, duplicate the code for each button, changing variables' name according to your needs. The timer is one for all, so no need to duplicate, simply duplicate and adjust code inside the timer.  
Have fun:)
