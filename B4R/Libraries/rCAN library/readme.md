This wraps the basic functions from [CAN library](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN) by Sandeep Mistry .  
  
The library makes it simple to communicate between Arduinos AND ESP32s using a 2 wire CAN bus. (fx. 100KBS at 1000m)  
You have to use Arduino to install the library.  
It supports UNO, MEGA and ESP32. (Tested with all 3)  
  
You can use fx. this shields:

[The ESP32 also needs a Can transceiver ( SN65HVD230 )](https://www.banggood.com/da/Waveshare-SN65HVD230-CAN-Bus-Module-Communication-CAN-Bus-Transceiver-Development-Board-p-1693712.html)  
  
Enjoy  
  
PS.   
Today (Jan 26/2025) the Can library is version 0.3.1 and it will only work with ESP board package up to version 2.0.17)
