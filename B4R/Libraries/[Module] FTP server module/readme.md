it is module to add FTP server on esp32 and esp8266  
  
2 examples of projects with FTP server on esp32 and esp8266 are available in creation section.  
  
Tests were done with Filezilla with a connection without TLS. (also with basic FTP client of windows 10)  
  
it is working in passive and active mode, you can store/retrieve/rename files, you can move up/down in all directories available or create new directories if needed.
