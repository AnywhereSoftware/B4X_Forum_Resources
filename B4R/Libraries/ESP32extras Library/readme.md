### ESP32extras Library by Starchild

[B4X Forum - B4R - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/106766/)

This is a cut-down derivative of my [rESP8266extras library](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/esp8266extras-library.72186/). I removed any functions that were not supported by the ESP32 environment.  
  
You can use the Demo Program provided at the top posting of the [rESP8266extras library](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/esp8266extras-library.72186/) to play around with this library (will need to make minor changes to use this library with the demo).  
  
Thanks to the B4X member "janderkan" who reminded me recently, that I never did a release of this library. It was originally written back in July 2018. But I stopped working on it around that time. I accidently sent it to janderkan when we were working on another library back in October 2018.  
  
As per janderkan's request I am posting it now on to the forum for general use.  
  
This rESP32extras library supported functions are:  
  
 Restart  
 FlashChipSpeed  
 CpuCycleCount  
 FreeHeapSpace  
 CpuFreqMHz  
 GetMacAddress  
 ConfigNetwork  
 ConfigAP  
 GetAPIP  
 IP2str  
 str2IP  
 Host2IP  
 IsBadIP  
 GetInternetIP  
 ConnectWPS  
 ConnectWPS2  
 SSID  
 GetLocalIP  
 GetSubnetMask  
 GetGatewayIP  
  
Hope it is useful to other.
