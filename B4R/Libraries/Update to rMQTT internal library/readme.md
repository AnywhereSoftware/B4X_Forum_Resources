### Update to rMQTT internal library by janderkan
### 12/20/2020
[B4X Forum - B4R - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/125456/)

This updates the [PubSubClient to v2.8](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)  
  
These functions have been added to B4R:  
*IsConnected  
SetBufferSize  
SetKeepAlive  
SetSocketTimeout*  
  
You must exchange the included folder and xml file in B4R folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Anywhere Software\B4R  
I hope that this could be added to B4R, so it isn't necessary to update after a B4R update.  
  
Add the folder and the xml file to your AddLibraries folder.  
  
Update: Name changed to rMQTT\_Ex
