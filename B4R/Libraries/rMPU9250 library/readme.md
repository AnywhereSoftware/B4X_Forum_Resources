this is library for MPU9250, based on MPU9250\_asukiaaa : <https://github.com/asukiaaa/MPU9250_asukiaaa>  
  
with this library, you can read Accelerometer, Gyrometer and Magnetometer of MPU9250.  
  
this library can work on wire, wire1 and wire2, based on HardWire or SoftwareWire  
  
parameters for configuration are available on B4R interface.  
  
a small B4R project is added, it was used to test this library.   
For tests, i bought 2 MPU9250 on Aliexpress and on first one Gyro was not answering , on second one Magnetometer was not working.   
 => on Aliexpress this module is cheap but not fiable, i saw a lot of peoples complaining
