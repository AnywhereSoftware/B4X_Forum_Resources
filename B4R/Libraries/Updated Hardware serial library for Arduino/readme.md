This library <https://github.com/i-am-bigmike/HardwareSerial_flow_control> allows CTS/RTS hardware handshake. You can keep on using same syntax or use the new extended Serialx.begin() syntax. It's a drop-in substitute for serial library you can found in Arduino, nothing to wrap or change. You have only to use one pin which is capable of Interrupt for serial input.
