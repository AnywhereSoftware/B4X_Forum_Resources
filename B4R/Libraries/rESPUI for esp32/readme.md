[B4X Forum - B4R - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/162435/)

it is a wrapper for ESPUI from <https://github.com/s00500/ESPUI> but wrapper is working only for ESP32.   
  
ESPUI is a simple library to make a web-based user interface for your projects using the **ESP8266** or the **ESP32** It uses web sockets and lets you create, and update elements on your GUI through multiple devices like phones and tablets.  
ESPUI uses simple Arduino-style syntax for creating a solid, functioning user interface without too much boilerplate code.  
  
So if you either don't know how or just don't want to waste time: this is your simple solution user interface without the need of internet connectivity or any additional servers.  
  
in B4R, objects can be created without call back or with call back when an activation of a sub is needed from object modification.  
in B4R, only one Callback is available and a sort of object at origin of call back is needed from userdata / controlType to activate a code from user action on object
