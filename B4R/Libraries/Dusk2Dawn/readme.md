I downloaded the Dusk2Dawn library [[Dusk2Dawn](https://github.com/dmkishi/Dusk2Dawn)] (talked about in this thread [<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/sunset-times.114477/#post-715173>])  
and made a B4R class to call the sunset routine using native c  
  
Here is the class.  
  
NOTE I only added the sunset routine (all I needed) but adding the sunrise is just a clone of sunset  
  
Works GR8. Calculates the exact time.  
  
A BIG Thanks to**[USER=34467] thetahsk,[/USER]** for pointing out this library to me.  
  
**Enjoy**
