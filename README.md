There are 4 development tools based on the B4X programming language:

*B4A* - Android apps.

*B4i* - iOS apps.

*B4J* - Windows, Mac, Linux and Raspberry Pi apps. UI, console and server. Based on Java / JavaFX.

The repo is organized into 4 folders and another *B4X folder* for cross platform resources - resources relevant to B4A, B4i and B4J.

libraries_mapping.json is an index of b4xlib libraries. It lists all libraries (only b4xlibs for now), with links and descriptions.
