Hello to you all,  
I decided to recreate this simple but effective game example, the game is based on the B4XPages library. The game is designed for hand, eye and memory coordination, so I called it 'Erel Says' ;)  
  
I've tried to make the code as simple as possible to follow for new to B4X developers. The code in B4XMainPage and B4XGame is cross platform and works with B4A, B4i and also B4J, I've added comments where feasible to do so. The code for the B4XSound module is also cross platform and can be found on the forum, I've added a link to the Erel's post to the code in the module.  
  
I've only used the standard B4X views for this tutorial. There's nothing complicated about this game, you can read the code and try to learn from it.
