Hello to you all,  
Here is a simple example on retrieving data from a REST API requested using the JSON Generator (you could also use http URL download), the same JSON library is also used to parse the received JSON data (2 JSON feeds). Once you receive the filtered JSON ticker data, displaying the results on xCharts is extremely simple to accomplish and shows 28 days worth of High and Low trading prices including the dates. The code in B4XMainPage is relatively simple to follow and works with B4i, B4A and also B4J, I've added comments where feasible to do so.  
  
**Please note that** not all the symbol names will display company ticker data, this is part of the limitations for using the free ticker REST API.
