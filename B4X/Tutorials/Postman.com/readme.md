Here is an app I knew it existed but I had never dared until now to try it and I regret this deeply. It is Postman. With this app available both on-line and as a local app (photo) you can check and fiddle making requests to on-line apis and eventually use the json/xml response in your apps. With just a word: "PERFECT".
