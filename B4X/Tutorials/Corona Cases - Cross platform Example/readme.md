Cross platform example based on B4XTable and [xChart](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/91830/#content) 4.70+.  
Follows the same structure as explained here: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-cross-platform-example.114125/#content>  
Practically all of the code is shared between the three platforms. The layouts were copied and pasted.  
  
The project includes a default dataset in the assets folder. It tries to download an updated dataset when the app starts.  
  
Depends on: xChart and other internal libraries.  
  
Executable jar (Java 8 needs to be installed): <https://www.b4x.com/b4j/files/CoronaCases.jar>  
  
Similar example based on xCustomListView instead of B4XTable: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/preoptimizedclv-lazy-loading-extension-for-xcustomlistview.115289/>
