###  [XUI] xChart Class and b4xlib by klaus

[B4X Forum - B4X - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/91830/)

**Current version 10.0**  
  
A lite version is available: [xChartLite](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-xchartlite-b4xlib.140197/).  
A mini version is also available:[xChartMini](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-xchartmini-b4xlib.146592/).  
  
Learning B4XViews and XUI, I wrote this CustomView xChart Class.  
It is an evolution of Erels' [Android Charts Framework](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/android-charts-framework.8260/).  
  
The xChart custom view is a B4X libary.  
It works on all three platforms: B4A, B4i and B4J.  
The xChart.b4xlib and the xChart.xml files are attached.  
You need to copy the xChart.b4xlib file to the AdditionlLibraries\B4X folder!  
The recommended AdditionlLibraries folder structure is explained [HERE](https://www.b4x.com/guides/B4XGettingStarted.html#pfa).  
  
Do not copy the xChart.xml file to the AdditionalLibraries folder, copy it in another folder for all b4xlib xml files.  
Example: AdditionlLibraries\B4XlibXMLFiles  
The xChart.xml file is for help purposes only and is useful with the B4X [Help Viewer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-help-viewer.46969/) or the [B4XObjectBrowser](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-b4i-b4j-and-b4r-api-documentation-b4x-object-browser.25682/#content).  
The xChart.xml file was generated with this tool: [b4xlib - XML generation](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/tool-b4xlib-xml-generation.101450/)  
  
It has automatic scales, linear and logarithmic, automatic text size according to the chart size.  
These can also be set manually.  
  
Demo projects for all three platforms as a B4XPages project.  
Tested on PC, Android Samsung S10, Samsung Tab S2, iPhone 8 and iPad.  
**B4XPagesxChartDemoV8\_8.zip** A B4XPages cross platform project using the xChart library, you need to copy the xChart.b4xlib file into your AdditionalLibraries\B4X folder.  
**B4JLogScaleV8\_8.zip** B4J project showing the logarithmic scales, it uses also the xChart library.  
**xChart.b4xlib** The xChart B4X library file. You must copy it into your your AdditionalLibraries\B4X folder.  
**xChart.xml** Help file, it is useful with the B4X [Help Viewer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-help-viewer.46969/) or the [B4XObjectBrowser](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-b4i-b4j-and-b4r-api-documentation-b4x-object-browser.25682/#content).  
 Donâ€™t copy the xChart.xml file to the AdditionalLibraries folder! Look above.

This image is from the B4JLogScale demo project, there is only a B4J project to show logarithmic scale examples.  
The principles are the same for the two other platforms.

The horizontal scale can be either on bottom, default, or on top.  
The vertical scale values can go from bottom to top, default, or from top to bottom.

When the cursor is on a point, the cross-hair color changes to the curve color and a circle is drawn at the point if no points are drawn.
