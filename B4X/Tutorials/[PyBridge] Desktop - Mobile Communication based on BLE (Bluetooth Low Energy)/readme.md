I've posted in the past a few examples of a simple chat app based on BLE: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/ble-chat-connecting-android-and-ios.66543/#content>  
A new version of this example is attached and B4J is now joining the party ðŸ¥³  
  
B4J, using the [Bleak library](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/pybridge-bleak-bluetooth-ble.165982), implements the central role and B4A or B4i implement the peripheral role. For simplicity the central connects to a single peripheral each time.  
  
Such solution can be useful in places where there is no wifi network, though the bandwidth is quite minimal.

Make sure to use latest version of Bleak: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/pybridge-bleak-bluetooth-ble.165982>  
And B4J v10.2 beta #4+  
  
For B4A and B4i, you also need to update to latest version of XUI Views: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-views-cross-platform-views-and-dialogs.100836/#content> (the example uses the new cross platform ProgressDialog).
