Example of implementing a chat layout.  
It is based on xCustomListView. The text is created with a hidden BBCodeView (BCTextEngine) and the bubble is drawn with BitmapCreator.  
Extracting the image from BBCodeView is not trivial. See the code.  
  
The code is implemented in the Chat class which is shared between the three projects.
