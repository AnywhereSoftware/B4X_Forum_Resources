LIMIT and OFFSET allow you to retrieve just a portion of the rows that are generated by the rest of the query.  
  
Official postgresql documentation:  
<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-limit.html>  
  
OFFSET says to skip that many rows before beginning to return rows. OFFSET 0 is the same as omitting the OFFSET clause, as is OFFSET with a NULL argument.  
  
If both OFFSET and LIMIT appear, then OFFSET rows are skipped before starting to count the LIMIT rows that are returned.  
  
When using LIMIT, it is important to use an ORDER BY clause that constrains the result rows into a unique order. Otherwise you will get an unpredictable subset of the query's rows. You might be asking for the tenth through twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what ordering? The ordering is unknown, unless you specified ORDER BY.  
  
Example:  

```B4X
    Dim Query As Supabase_DatabaseSelect = xSupabase.Database.SelectData  
    Query.Columns("*").From("dt_Tasks")  
    Query.OrderBy("Tasks_Id.desc")  
    Query.Limit(1)  
    Query.Offset(1)  
    Wait For (Query.Execute) Complete (DatabaseResult As SupabaseDatabaseResult)  
    xSupabase.Database.PrintTable(DatabaseResult)
```
