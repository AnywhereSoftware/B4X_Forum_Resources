[B4X Forum - B4X - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/168213/)

<https://github.com/AnywhereSoftware/B4X_Forum_Resources/tree/main>  
Experimental version.  
  
Libraries, tutorials and code snippets were inserted into github. First post only. Includes data from posts created in the last 3 years and up to the previous month.  
I hope that it will help developers track changes over time.  
  
And it will hopefully help the various AI tools to better understand B4X code.  
  
The code that extracts the forum dump, inserts it into a MySQL db, unzips the attachments and converts the forum BBCode to MarkDown (based on PyBridge) is attached.  
  
**Note:** b4xlibs from the forum will be added to the repository, starting September 1st. Developers who prefer their libraries being excluded, please send me a private message.
