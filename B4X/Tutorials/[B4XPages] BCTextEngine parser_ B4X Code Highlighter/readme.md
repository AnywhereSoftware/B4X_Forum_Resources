This is an example of creating a custom parser for BBCodeView. It depends on BCTextEngine v1.61+ which allows setting the text runs directly instead of parsing the BBCode.  
  
The parser is compatible with B4A, B4J and B4i. Note that in B4J the text looks less clear with the dark theme due to the antialiasing method used and the small text. It does look good with the dark theme in B4A and B4i.  
  
The class is included in the B4A example.  
  
It is an example. It doesn't support all of B4X programming language features.
