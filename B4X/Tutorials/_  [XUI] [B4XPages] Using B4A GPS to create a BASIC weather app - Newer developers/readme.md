Hello All  
Here we have an simple example on how you use your Android device GPS in conjunction with OpenWeather API, this is just a simple example and can obviously be changed and updated by yourselves. The code in B4XMainPage is also used in B4i and B4J examples, I've added comments where feasible to do so. The 'YourLocation' module is platform specific and should be simple enough for any new B4X developers to follow.

The zip file in the link below contains the OpenWeather B4XPages project for B4A, B4i and also B4j. They all use the same layout file and designer script.
