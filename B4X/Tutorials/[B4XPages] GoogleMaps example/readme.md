Example of showing a Google map, in a cross platform B4XPages project. The APIs of the three GoogleMaps libraries are quite different from one another, so we need to use platform specific code for the map creation. Still, it is quite simple to further extend this project and build a cross platform solution.  
  
A different key is required for each platform:

B4i - <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/47019/#content>  
  
In B4i you need to add GoogleMaps.bundle to B4i\Files\Special. It was removed as it is too big for the forum. You can find it in the example project from the above tutorial.  
  
Note that there was an issue in iGoogleMaps v1.41. It was fixed in the hosted builders and will be included in the local builders of B4i v6.80.
