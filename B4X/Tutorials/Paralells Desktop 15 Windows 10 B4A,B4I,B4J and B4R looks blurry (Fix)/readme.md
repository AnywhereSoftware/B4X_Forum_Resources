Hello,  
  
i have searched for a long time for a fix for this, every time i have B4A on my second monitor on my mac, then the text was blurry and this was no fun to work withâ€¦  
  
Now i have a fix for this.  
  

1. right-Click on the B4A,B4I,B4J or B4R icon
2. click "open file path"
3. right-Click on the icon
4. click "properties"
5. click "compatibility"
6. "change high dpi settings"
7. then set the hook on "Behavior at high DPI scaling"
8. open the Drop-Down box and set it to "system"

I Translate the wording from German to English, I don't know if it was translated the same way for Windows in English.
