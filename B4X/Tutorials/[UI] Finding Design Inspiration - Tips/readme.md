I would like to list here and give some tips where I get my design ideas for the apps I develope.  
  

1. Very simple, for example i want to design a Bottom Card, then i type on google images "bottom sheet"

2. Uplabs.com is a nice design website, with a daylie new showcase

3. [uimovement.com](http://uimovement.com) is a nice website with animated design- or components-examples
4. [collectui.com](https://collectui.com/) large selection of categories
5. On the Google Playstore are several UI apps where you can try out various components or pages directly

1. CodeX

2. MaterialX

1. <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.material.components&hl=de>

6. Take a look at the apps from the big ones, e.g. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube

1. For example, I recently added a comment section in an app where you can also reply. I first took a look at how the big apps do it, made screenshots and then made a mix of them

I hope I could show you some ways to make your app look better.
