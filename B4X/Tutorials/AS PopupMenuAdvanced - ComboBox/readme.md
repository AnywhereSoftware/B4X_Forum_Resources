This is a small example to demonstrate what is possible with the beautiful view.

The combobox consists of the following components:  

1. Base Panel that holds the 2 other views

1. Label for the text
2. Label for the arrow icon

2. AS PopupMenuAdvanced for the selections

When you click on the Base panel, we just add the PopupMenu to it.  
  
Have Fun :)
