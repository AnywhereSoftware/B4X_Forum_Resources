GitHub: <https://github.com/pyhoon/B4XTableSample-B4X/tree/main/example3>  
[HEADING=2]Features[/HEADING]  

- Sample data added to [**MinimaListUtils**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-minimalistutils.155724/) and persisted with **KeyValueStore**
- Perform CRUD functions like add, retrieve, edit, delete rows
- Use B4XPreferencesDialog to show the panel for input
- Jump to a row in B4XTable
- Same as [example2](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-b4xtable-sample-working-with-sqlite.168336/) which is working with SQLite database

[HEADING=2]Why I created this sample project[/HEADING]
