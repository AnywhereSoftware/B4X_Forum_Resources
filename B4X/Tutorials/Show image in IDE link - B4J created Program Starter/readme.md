Good morning to all of you,  
  
some times I find it easier to make notes on a paper with a pen. I am a visual person and I understand something better this way. At several times I move my notes to another room and I am forced to go fetch them. This is against productivity so I came up with the following approach to avoid this:  
  
1) I write down the note to paper (mosty shapes)  
2) I scan it and get the scanned file to a folder where it is always reachable by the IDE (I mean not a USB).  
3) I am using the attached B4J program and the following IDE link to take a look at my notes whenever I want to do this, not having to migrate two times (forth-back) to the next roomâ€¦ ðŸ˜„  
  

```B4X
'* ide://run?file=%JAVABIN%\java.exe&args=-jar&args=D:\Programming\B4X\MyCode\B4J\ProgramStarter\Objects\ProgramStarter.jar&args=D:\Programming\B4X\MyCode\ImageNotes\Projects\YachtCompanion\Scan13860.JPG
```

  
  
The attached file can be used also to start other programs. The only way that it is different from the built in IDE Links program starter is that it starts several file types with the default program (for example png, jpg). Just make sure you compile it to jar and change its folder in the above link.
