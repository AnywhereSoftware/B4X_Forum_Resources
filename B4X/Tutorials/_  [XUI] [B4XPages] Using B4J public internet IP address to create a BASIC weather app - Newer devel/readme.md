Hello All  
Here we have an simple example on how you use your desktop OS (in this example Windows) and public internet IP address in conjunction with OpenWeather API, this is just a simple example and can obviously be changed and updated by yourselves. The code in B4XMainPage is also used in B4A and B4i examples, I've added comments where feasible to do so. The 'YourLocation' module is platform specific and should be simple enough for any new B4X developers to follow.  
  
[**CLICK HERE**](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) to register for **FREE** at OpenWeather to use their weather API.  
  
**PLEASE NOTE:** As the weather forecast in this particular app is based on your public internet IP address, the weather forecast could be a few miles away (1.4 miles in my case), that's close enough ;)

The zip file in the link below contains the OpenWeather B4XPages project for B4A, B4i and also B4j. They all use the same layout file and designer script.
