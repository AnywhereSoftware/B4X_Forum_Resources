Seeing the [**new Template feature**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-projects-templates.119901/#content), I thought I'd use it for the new libraries I create.  
I created a Template that opens three folders (B4J, B4A, B4I) with the library.  
  
In addition to the main page (for the three platforms) it will create a XUIcustomView called Library, but also a XUIcustomView with the name of the app that you can add as an existing module.  
  
If it can be useful to others, use it
