Green API is a platform that allows you to send and receive WhatsApp messages through a stable API.  
1. It is possible to send and receive text, photos and videos without the need to purchase and monitor a phone  
2. Stable WhatsApp API works without a phone and your number is safe when using WhatsApp API Gateway  
3. The API is fast, with a capacity of sending 120 messages per minute and receiving 600 messages per minute  
  
The platform also offers different plans for different needs, from free plans to business plans that allow unlimited chats and up to 30,000 WhatsApp verifications per month.
