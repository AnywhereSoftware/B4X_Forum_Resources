I have made a few modifications to [CLVExpandable](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-clvexpandable-allows-expanding-or-collapsing-xcustomlistview-items.106148/) to show an expandable 'business card' style view with rounded corners as if they are stacked on top of each other.  
  
As always, thanks to the creators that helped without even knowing it.  
  
Invaluable mention for [SetPanelCornerRadius](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-setpanelcornerradius-only-for-certain-corners.164567/)

\*All names are randomly generated  
  
There are also a couple of handy helpers in the project too - One to generate repeatable colors from supplied text rather than using random colors and one to figure out the best contrast text color from a list of possibles given a supplied background color.  
  
All code is in the demo
