Hi,  
This is a modified custom view of the class library -> [GridManager [B4J]](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/custom-view-gridmanager.79144/).  
It should be compatible with b4j, b4a and b4i.  
Note this is for simple grids if you need something more complex then -> [GridClassPreoptimizedCLV](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/grid-class-preoptimizedclv.116309/#post-726808)  
  
This thread should be move to -> Additional libraries, classes and official updates.  
my bad.
