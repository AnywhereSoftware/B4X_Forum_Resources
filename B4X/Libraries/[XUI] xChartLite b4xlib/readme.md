###  [XUI] xChartLite b4xlib by klaus
### 01/01/2025
[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/140197/)

**Current version : 1.8**  
  
xChartLite is a b4xlib library, it is a lite version of the [xChart library](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-xchart-class-and-b4xlib.91830/#content).  
A mini version is also available:[xChartMini](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-xchartmini-b4xlib.146592/).  
  
It has automatic scales, automatic text size according to the chart size.  
These can also be set manually.  
  
I am convinced that many user do not need all kind of different possible charts and settings.  
The size of the code is almost one third of the full version.  
  
Supported charts:  
- Pie  
- Bar  
- Stacked bar  
- Lines  
  
The demo project is a B4XPages project using the xChartLite library.  
Tested on PC, Android Samsung S10, Samsung Tab S2, iPhone 8 and iPad.  
**xChartDemoV1\_4.zip** B4XPages cross platform project using the xChartLite library, you need to copy the xChartLite.b4xlib file into your AdditionalLibraries\B4X folder.  
**xChartLite.b4xlib** The xChartLite B4X library file. You must copy it into your your AdditionalLibraries\B4X folder.  
**xChartLite.xml** Help file, it is useful with the B4X [Help Viewer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-help-viewer.46969/) or the [B4XObjectBrowser](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-b4i-b4j-and-b4r-api-documentation-b4x-object-browser.25682/#content).  
 **Donâ€™t copy the xChartLite.xml file to the AdditionalLibraries folder!**
