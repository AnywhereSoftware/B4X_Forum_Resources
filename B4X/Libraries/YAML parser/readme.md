A simple parser, similar to the json parser, for YAML strings.  
  
It is compatible with B4A and B4J.  
It is based on: <https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/yamlbeans> (MIT license)  
  
Put yaml.jar in the additional libraries folder and add a reference with:  

```B4X
#AdditionalJar: yaml.jar
```

  
  
Note that booleans and dates will return as strings.
