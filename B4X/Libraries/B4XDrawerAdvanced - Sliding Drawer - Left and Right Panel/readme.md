[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/143543/)

I took the original [B4XDrawer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-b4xdrawer-sliding-drawer.97828/#content) code from [USER=1]@Erel[/USER] and modified it to create a new view.  
  
This view supports right panel in B4A and B4I. What was often requested.  
  
I spend a lot of time in creating views, some views i need by my self, but some views not and to create a high quality view cost a lot of time. If you want to support me, then you can do it [here by Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/stoltex) or with a [coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/astolte). :)
