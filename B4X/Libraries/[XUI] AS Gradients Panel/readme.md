First, i spend a lot of time in creating views, some views i need by my self, but some views not and to create a high quality view cost a lot of time. If you want to support me, then you can do it [here by Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=PBJGJWDDSM6ZG). :)  
  
**This is the First Version, if you have bugs, then ask in the comments.**  
  
With this view you can create gradients panels, with dynamic colors and sizes.  
Looks better in realâ€¦ i found it funny, that a .mp4 with high quality has a smaller size than a .gif
