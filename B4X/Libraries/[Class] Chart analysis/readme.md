### [Class] Chart analysis by peacemaker

As i could not find any ready code to make analysis of the curve\chart\data flow, i have tried to make something. It was discussed [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/chart-analysis.136011) (thanks to all in the thread!)  
  
If to have a chart, i mean, the data table with 2 columns, say weather temperature per hour - it would be good to have an analysis code that can check the data changing trend and return some result.  
Say, the result may be like "Temperature is rising during 5 hours", or "Warning: sudden freeze for -20 degrees during 5 hours !" â€¦  
  
This is first my result of such class, tested in B4J mainly, and in B4A. I do not have B4i (i guess, should work as no platform specifics).  
  
  
The project depends on:  

- SQLite lib
- DBUtils code module
- For visual testing: xChart lib
