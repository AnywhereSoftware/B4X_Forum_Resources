FlipSwitch v1.00  
  
My first attempt to create a CustomView.  
It support B4A, B4J and B4i.  
I want to Thank [USER=51832]@LucaMs[/USER] for giving me the will to do it and the beginning idea.  
It's simply yet another ON/OFF switch.

It feature a flap that got animated to change the state of the switch.  
The colors (green and red) are fixed as they are images.  
  
Features:  
- Set the Initial Value (green or red)  
- Customizable flipping speed  
- Customizable text, text size and text color on both sides  
- Value can be read or changed by code  
- Size can be changed by code (max width as been set to 140dip to maintain graphic acceptable, larger size will be reduced to 140dip automatically)  
- Left, Top, Right, Bottom, Width and Height are exposed and can both be read or changed by code  
- ValueChanged Event is raised at every flip  
  
Normally everything it's expected to be set from the Designer.  
Thank You All!
