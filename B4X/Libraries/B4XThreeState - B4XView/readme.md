I needed something similar to StateListDrawable B4A but cross-platform (B4X).  
  
Since I was in a hurry, I settled for developing it just for the images.  
  
Obviously you can replace the 3 images (for the 3 states: ENABLED, DISABLED, PRESSED) via properties.  
  
Events: Click and LongClick.

I don't own Apple stuff (iOS, Mac, â€¦), so I can't guarantee that it will also work with B4i (but being a B4XLib library, you have the source code and can fix it if necessary).
