Cross platform (B4A, B4J, B4I) simple but useful input dialog, based on B4XDialog (ShowCustom).  
  
Easily customizable.

It may not seem like it but it took some work; mainly because only almost at the completion of the work, I realized that B4XFloatTextField does not allow you to set the KeyboardType property (for Text, Numbers, Decimals inputs) by code, it is available only in the Designer, so I had to modify this class and it is not a simple addition (I changed its name slightly, so that it is quite distinct from the original). [I will ask for this change](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4xfloattextfield-keyboardtype-property-by-code.139418/post-882742) to be made in the official library.  
  
Since the last custom view I published ([CLVItemToolbox](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/139304/#content)) was not very successful (incompetent and tasteless people ?) nor was I offered a coffee for it, I will provide this one (and any future ones) only on request (here or in private).
