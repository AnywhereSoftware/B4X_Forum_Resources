This class replaces the custom CustomListView module (<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-expandable-list-based-on-xcustomlistview.86449/>).  
It works with the standard xCustomListView library.  
It is compatible with B4A, B4i and B4J.  
  
Instructions:  
  
An expandable item layout should be made of two panels. The first one is the title and the second one is the item's body.  
The title panel should include at least two items where the second item is a view with the arrow (you can easily change this by modifying the code).  
**The item layout background must be transparent.**  
It is also recommended to remove AutoScaleAll from the item layout.  
  
The class is included in the attached examples.
