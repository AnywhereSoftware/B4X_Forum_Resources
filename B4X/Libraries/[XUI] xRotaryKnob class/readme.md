[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/96045/)

The xRotaryKnob Class is a B4X libary.  
NEW The demo project is a B4XPages project.  
The zip file contains the B4XPages project.  
It works on all three platforms: B4A, B4i and B4J.  
The xRotaryKnob.b4xlib and the xRotaryKnob.xml files are attached.  
You need to copy the xRotaryKnob.b4xlib file to the AdditionlLibraries\B4X folder!  
Donâ€™t copy the xRotaryKnob.xml file to the AdditionalLibraries folder, copy it in another folder for all b4xlib xml files.  
Example: AdditionlLibraries\B4XlibXMLFiles  
The xRotaryKnob.xml file is for help purposes only and is useful with the B4X [Help Viewer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-help-viewer.46969/) or the [B4XObjectBrowser](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-b4i-b4j-and-b4r-api-documentation-b4x-object-browser.25682/#content).  
The xRotaryKnob.xml was generated with this tool: [b4xlib - XML generation](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xml2map-simple-way-to-parse-xml-documents.74848/)  
  
After a request from [HERE](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/rotary-knob-post.95626/#content), I made it as a XUI challenge.  
You can turn the button, and it snaps onto the nearest value.  
A click in the middle selects the next value, a LonkClick in the middle selects the prevous value.  
There are three snap modes:  
AFTERMOVE snaps when the knob is released, upper left knob.  
ALLWAYS snaps allways during moving, the lower green knob.  
NEVER doesn't snap at all, displays the current value.  
  
**Custom button images**:  
There are two conditions for these images:  
- if the button is not a circle, the background must be a color and not transparent  
- the reference point must be at the right or the arrow must point to the right, geometric angle ZERO or 3 o'clock.  
  
EDIT: 2024.01.04 Version 1.8  
Added ValueChanged event when the Value is set by code  
  
EDIT: 2023.08.10 Version 1.7  
Added ValueChanged event for all SnapModes  
Attention: Changed the Value variable type in the ValueChanged event from Int To Double  
If you use the ValueChanged event you need to change it in your projects !  
Amended problem of highlighted scale value  
The demo project is now a B4XPages project !  
  
EDIT: 2021.04.02 Version 1.6  
Added HandleLineColor property  
Amended error with mAngle0 and B4i  
  
EDIT: 2020.06.23 Version 1.5  
Added following properties:  
SnapToZero when True snaps to ZERO after releasing the knob.  
If there is no ZERO position in the scale, it snaps to the position nearest to ZERO.  
The duration of the snap can be set with the SnapToZeroDuration property  
SnapToZeroDuration in milliseconds.  
Updated the Tag property according to Erels recommendation:

EDIT: 2019.04.09 Version 1.4  
Amended CustomKnobFileName property variable type.  
  
EDIT: 2019.04.09 Version 1.3  
Added Visible property.  
  
EDIT: 2019.04.08 Version 1.2

Added CustomKnob and CustomKnobFileName properties.  
Allows to use a bitmap for the knob image.
