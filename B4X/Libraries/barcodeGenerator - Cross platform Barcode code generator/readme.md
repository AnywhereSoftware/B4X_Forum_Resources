codeBarGenerator is a class that generates barcodes.  
  
It is written in B4X and is compatible with B4A, B4i and B4J.  
  
At the moment the class only generates barcode in **EAN13, UPC-A and CODE128-B** format, you can modify the class and improve it even more.  
  
**Versions**  
  
V1.02 - barcode in CODE128-B.  
V1.01 - barcode in UPC-A.  
V1.00 - barcode in EAN13.
