**[SIZE=6]B4XAES b4xlib v2.0 [/SIZE]**[SIZE=6]works with B4A, B4i and B4J[/SIZE]  
  
Requires:  
jB4XEncryption library  
StringUtils  
  
This extends the functionality of Erel's great library.  
Another contribution to the community :cool:??  
  
  
EDIT: This library has been updated to version 2.0  
It should be much simpler to work with AES now.  
Thanks to Erel for making this possible.  
  
Put it in the Additional Libraries folder and rock 'n' roll  
  
Enjoy!
