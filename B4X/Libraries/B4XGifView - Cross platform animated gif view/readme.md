I was missing a cross platform, animated gif view, so created one.  
  
Usage is simple:  
Add with the visual designer and call SetGif to set the gif file.  
  
  
The B4i implementation depends on FLAnimatedImage open source project: <https://github.com/Flipboard/FLAnimatedImage>  
The FLAnimatedImage library was uploaded to the hosted builders. If you are using a local Mac then download FLAnimatedImage-Mac and copy the files to the Libs folder.  
The B4A implementation is based on this open source project: <https://github.com/koral--/android-gif-drawable>  
The two dependent aars are attached. Copy them to B4A additional libraries folder.  
  
Updates:  
  
1.15 - Updated the B4A dependencies to fix a compatibility issue with targetSdkVersion 35.  
1.12 - SetGif2 - Allows loading an animated gif from an array of bytes.  
1.11 - GIF image ratio is preserved.  
1.10 - New B4A implementation based on Android GIF Drawable. It provides better performance. Note that the Activity\_Resume method has been removed. Don't miss the B4A-Dependencies zip file.
