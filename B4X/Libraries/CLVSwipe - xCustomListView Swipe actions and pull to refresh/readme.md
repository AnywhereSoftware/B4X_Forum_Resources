CLVSwipe is a class that adds "swipe actions" and pull to refresh features to the standard xCustomListView library.  
  
It is compatible with B4A and B4i (currently not with B4J).  
Both features are optional.

Using it is simple:  
  
1. Add the class to your project. It depends on XUI, xCustomListView and ViewsEx [v1.30](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/updates-to-internal-libraries.59340/#post-616520)+.  
2. Initialize Swipe and pass the CustomListView.  
3. In B4i, call Swipe.Resize when the page is resized.  
  
Adding action commands:  
  
- Set the action colors:  

```B4X
Swipe.ActionColors = CreateMap("Delete": xui.Color_Red, "Do Something Else": xui.Color_Green, _  
       "Action 1": xui.Color_Red, "Action 2": xui.Color_Blue, "Action 3": xui.Color_Yellow)
```

  
- Create the items values with Swipe.CreateItemValue:  

```B4X
CustomListView1.AddTextItem($"Important item ${i} â€¦"$, Swipe.CreateItemValue("", Array("Delete", "Do Something Else")))
```

  
- Handle the ActionClicked event:  

```B4X
Sub Swipe_ActionClicked (Index As Int, ActionText As String)
```

  
  
Pull to refresh:  
  
- Create the PullToRefreshPanel panel. This is the panel that appears when the user pulls the list.  
- Set it with Swipe.PullToRefreshPanel.  
- Handle the RefreshRequested event. Make sure to call Swipe.RefreshCompleted when done.  
- In B4i you need to call Swipe.ScrollChanged from the ScrollChanged event.  
  
B4A and B4i projects are attached. Note that the class module is identical in both projects.
