Hi Fam  
  
I’m excited to share a deep dive into **B4XDaisyFieldset**, a custom B4XView class that allows you to create beautifully grouped form controls with minimal effort. If you've ever struggled with keeping your UI forms neat and aesthetically pleasing across devices, this component is a game-changer.

**✨ Key Features:**  
• **Tailwind-Style Theming:** Easily utilize Tailwind-like text size tokens (from text-xs to text-xl) and color variants (neutral, primary, secondary, accent, info, success, warning, error) for your borders and backgrounds.  
• **Customizable Borders & Shadows:** Choose from outlined, ghost, or inset border visual styles. You can also apply elevation shadows ranging from none to xs, sm, md, lg, xl to create depth in your UI.  
• **Dynamic Auto-Height:** No more manual resizing! By enabling the AutoHeight designer property, the fieldset will automatically grow vertically to perfectly fit any content you add to it.  
• **Flexible Design:** Customize the legend text, text color, inner padding (defaults to 16dip or 'p-4'), and toggle between rounded corners or full rounded boxes.  
**🛠️ Using the Component:** You can add the component directly via the designer and set properties like the Legend caption, or create it dynamically in code.  
  
Adding controls inside the fieldset is simple. You just use the AddContentView method, passing in your view along with its left, top, width, and height dimensions. If you want a modern, borderless card look with a colorful background, you can set the border style to ghost and apply a variant background like primary or success.  
  
Whether you are building simple parity fieldsets, complex details forms, or beautiful grouped cards, B4XDaisyFieldset has you covered. Drop any questions below and happy coding!
