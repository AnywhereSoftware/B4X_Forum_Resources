lmB4XComboBox is a b4x library (<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/100383/#content>).  
**It works with B4A, B4J and B4i.**  
  
It is a modified version of the Erel's original B4XComboBox and allows you to store in it a value for each text item.  
Not rarely (mainly handling DB data) you need a ComboBox in which an Item is made of a display value and an associated value, i.e. a "description field" of a table and the relative primary key (usually the classic Integer ID).  
Note that the type of the values associated is **object**, not just Int; this means that you can associate any type of value to each item.  
  
**Members added to the original View:  
  
AddItem(Text As String)** - to add a single text item  
**AddItem2(Text As String, Value As Object)** - to add a single item with text and value  
**GetItems** - returns the full list of texts  
**GetItemText(Index As Int)** - returns the text of an item  
**GetItemValue(Index As Int)** - returns the value associated to an item  
**GetValues** - returns all the values associated  
**RemoveItemByIndex(Index as Int)** - removes an item  
**RemoveItemByText(Text As String)** - removes an item  
**RemoveItemByValue(Value As Object)** - removes an item  
**SetItems2(Texts As List, Values as List)** - to set all items with values  
**[SIZE=5]SetItemsFromSQLite(â€¦) - to fill the combo from a SQLite table[/SIZE]**  
**SetValue(Index as Int, Value as Object)** - to set the value of a specific item

To run the example project, you need to download the Chinook\_Sqlite.sqlite database from:  
<https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/>  
(and place it in the files folder, of course).
