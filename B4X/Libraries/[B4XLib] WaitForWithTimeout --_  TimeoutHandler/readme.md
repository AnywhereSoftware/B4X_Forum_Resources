### [B4XLib] WaitForWithTimeout -->  TimeoutHandler by LucaMs

[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/110703/)

I have read many times the request for a "Wait For" with the addition of a timeout.  
  
This class is an attempt to implement that functionality.  
  
It is a B4X class, in the sense that it can be used with B4A, B4J and B4i; after all it uses only one B4XView which is completely optional and almost never necessary.  
  
I don't list the methods and properties here; each of them has its own description in the source (even if they are not very "studied" descriptions).  
  
The class is in the attached example project, of course (it's not a smart/beautiful example :D)  
  
  
 *Wrong place, the project attached is a B4J project! Sorry.  
**Attached the B4XLib (V. 1.11)**  
  
TimeoutHandler attached (see post [#9](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-waitforwithtimeout.110703/#post-691187))  
  
TimeoutHandler V. 1.1  
- Just added the description of the method with example code (useful, copy & paste)*
