This is a modified version of the B4XSwitch class wich allows you to set the On,Off and Thumbcolors in code.  
Just replace it inside your XUI Views.b4xlib. You can also rename the class to use it beside the official XUI Views  
Maybe this can be added in future official updates  
  
  

```B4X
    B4XSwitch1.OnColor=Theme.SelectionBackground  
    B4XSwitch1.OffColor=Theme.Disabled  
    B4XSwitch1.ThumbColor=Theme.AccentColor
```
