###  [XUI] AS CalendarExpandableðŸ“… [Payware] by Alexander Stolte
### 05/26/2025
[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/146808/)

This view was developed from scratch based on the [AS\_DatePicker](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-datepicker-fast-navigate-to-a-month-year-decade-century-rangedatepicker.139957/) and the AS\_CalendarViewWeek from the [AS\_Scheduler](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-scheduler-%F0%9F%93%85-monthview-dayview-week-agendaview-and-calendarview-payware.138410/). Both combined results in a fantastic new view.  
  
**Those who have already purchased** [**AS\_CalendarAdvanced**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-calendaradvanced-%F0%9F%93%85-onerow-fiverow-calendar-expand-and-collapse-payware.128809/) **can use the same key to use this library.**  
  
This library is **not free**, because, it cost a lot of time and gray hair to create such views.  
<https://payhip.com/b/dq0uS>  
Thanks for your understanding. :)  
  
The calendar can be **collapsed** and **expanded**
