HeyHo,  
  
i spend a lot of time in creating views, some views i need by my self, but some views not and to create a high quality view cost a lot of time. If you want to support me, then you can do it [here by Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=PBJGJWDDSM6ZG). :)  
  
This view was inspired by [Image Comparison Slider](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_image_comparison.asp) and [this](https://codyhouse.co/demo/image-comparison-slider/index.html).
