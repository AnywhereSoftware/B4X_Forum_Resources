[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/129190/)

It is a personal project of mine that I started as a hobby on B4i and it has become an interesting project, so that I have modified it to be multiplatform.  
  
It is an http server, which allows a browser to navigate on html pages stored on the device. In addition, dynamic pages can also be created. Read the parameters of the GET and POST commands and read and write the COOKIES in the browser.  
It also implements the WebSocket, starting from an example published in this forum by [USER=1]@Erel[/USER] for the jServer library. I also made the jQueryElement class to interface with the JavaScript elements of the Browser page.  
(You can get the source of the [**QueryElement**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/httpserver-and-b4x.126674/post-829378) class at this Post)  
  
Obviously it is not at the level of existing and established servers, but it is a project that I want to share and that I think can be useful since it is cross-platform. The examples are in post 2  
  
It is entirely written in B4X.   
It may have some bugs  
It does not support SSL / TLS. I didn't understand how it works.
