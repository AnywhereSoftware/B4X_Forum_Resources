XUI Views is a b4x library (<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/100383/#content>). The same b4xlib library is compatible with B4A, B4i and B4J  
  
It is a collection of custom views and dialogs. Everything is written in B4X. The source code is included inside the b4xlib file, which is a zip file.  
  
Views:  
  
- B4XRadioButton - Cross platform radio button.  
- B4XComboBox - Cross platform ComboBox / Spinner / ActionSheet.  
- ScrollingLabel - A label that scrolls the text when it is wider than the label. Search for BBScrollingLabel for a similar view that supports rich text.  
- AnotherProgressBar - Vertical or horizontal animated progress bar.  
- B4XLoadingIndicator - 6 different animated loading indicators.  
- RoundSlider - A round slider.  
- SwiftButton - 3d button  
- AnimatedCounter  
- B4XFloatTextField - A TextField / EditText with a floating hint  
- B4XSwitch - Nice looking two state control.  
- B4XPlusMinus - Allows the user to select a number or item from a previously set list.  
- B4XBreadCrumb - Navigation control.  
- B4XSeekBar - Horizontal or vertical seek bar / slider.  
- MadeWithLove - Show your love to B4X :)  
- B4XImageView - ImageView with useful resize modes: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-b4ximageview-imageview-resize-modes.121359/>  
- XUIViewsUtils - Static code module with various utility methods.  
  
Dialogs:  
  
- B4XDialog - A class that provides the features required to show a dialog. There are three methods to show dialogs: Show - Shows a simple dialog with text, ShowCustom - Allows you to pass a layout of your own and show it as a dialog, ShowTemplate - Shows a dialog based on a template class. See the source code for the template structure. It is quite simple.  
  
Available templates:  
  
- B4XDateTemplate - Based on AnotherDatePicker.  
- B4XColorTemplate - Nice color picker.  
- B4XLongTextTemplate - Scrollable text.  
- B4XListTemplate - A list of items. The user can choose one of the items.  
- B4XSignatureTemplate - Captures the user signature and adds a timestamp to the bitmap.  
- B4XInputTemplate - Template for text and numeric inputs.  
- B4XSearchTemplate - A list with a search field. An evolution of SearchView.  
- B4XTimedTemplate - A template that wraps other templates and creates a dialog that closes automatically after the set time with a nice animated progress bar.  
- B4XProgressDialog - A template + its own dialog. Cross platform alternative to B4A ProgressDialogShow.  
  
It is simple to add more templates.  
Tutorial about B4XDialogs: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/101197>  
  
More views and templates will be added in future versions.  
  
The examples projects are quite simple. Don't miss the following snippets:  
  
B4i:  

```B4X
Private Sub Page1_Resize(Width As Int, Height As Int)  
   If Dialog.Visible Then Dialog.Resize(Width, Height)  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub Application_Background  
   Dialog.Close(XUI.DialogResponse_Cancel)  
End Sub
```

  
B4A:  

```B4X
Sub Activity_KeyPress (KeyCode As Int) As Boolean 'Return True to consume the event  
  If KeyCode = KeyCodes.KEYCODE_BACK And Dialog.Close(XUI.DialogResponse_Cancel) Then Return True  
   Return False  
End Sub  
  
Sub Activity_Resume  
   'required to continue the animation after the activity is paused (only needed when not using B4XPages)  
   AnotherProgressBar1.Visible = True  
   B4XLoadingIndicator1.Show  
   B4XLoadingIndicator2.Show  
   ScrollingLabel1.Text = ScrollingLabel1.Text  
End Sub  
  
Sub Activity_Pause (UserClosed As Boolean)  
   Dialog.Close (XUI.DialogResponse_Cancel)  
End Sub
```

  
B4J:  

```B4X
Sub MainForm_Resize (Width As Double, Height As Double)  
   If Dialog.Visible Then Dialog.Resize(Width, Height)  
End Sub
```

  
  
**Updates**  
  
V2.66 - B4XFloatTextField.ShowAcceptButtonWhenEmpty field. If True then the V button appears even if the text field is empty. It is True by default in B4i. This is useful to allow the user to hide the keyboard.
