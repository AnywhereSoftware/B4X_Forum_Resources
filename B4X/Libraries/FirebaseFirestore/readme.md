Good day & evening  
This is a Firestore Library I've been perfecting since late last year since most of my projects I use Firebase.  
I used Firebase REST APIs and made it Look, Feel & Work like the original.  
Does not conflict with other Firebase Libraries  
Works the same way as: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/firebaseadmin-library.155115/>  
  
If you wanna support my work you can do that [by buying me a coffeeâ˜•](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/claudeamadu)

**HOSTING THE HTML**  
First you'll need to install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli?authuser=0#install_the_firebase_cli)  

1. Create a folder and open the folder in VS Code
2. In the terminal run **firebase init hosting**
3. When its done copy the **index.html** to the **public** folder
4. Edit the paste your firebase config
5. In the terminal run **firebase deploy â€“only hosting**
6. Check if it works by visiting **<https://PROJECT_ID.web.app/?collection=>[A collection here]** in a browser
7. View the browser console if you see logs as below of your collection then you're set to go
