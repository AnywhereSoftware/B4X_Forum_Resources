[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/102476/)

First, i spend a lot of time in creating views, some views i need by my self, but some views not and to create a high quality view cost a lot of time. If you want to support me, then you can do it [here by Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=PBJGJWDDSM6ZG). :)  
  
This Class is optimized for B4A and B4I, but not for B4J.  
  
**This is the First Version, if you have bugs, then ask in the comments.**  
  
This is a Lock View, to secure private user data in the app, the user must enter a code to get ahead.

You can encrypt the input with the following methods  

- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-224
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512
- NONE (the output is 12345678 for example without encryption)

You can set a Salt value to the Hash.  
And so it works:  
1 + Salt Optional = Hash  
2 + Salt Optional = Hash  
3 + Salt Optional = Hash  
4 + Salt Optional = Hash  
  
Hash1 + Hash2 + Hash3 + Hash4 + Salt = Final Hash  
The Final Hash you must save and then you can compare the hash with the user input.  
  
**Features**  

- you can use your own Layout on the Header (header.LoadLayout("tst.bal"))
- background and textcolor color is customizable
- the Fingerprint icon is just a placeholder for your own function like a Fingerprint or a questionmark for help
- MD5,SHA-1,SHA-224,SHA-256,SHA-384 and SHA-512 to encrypt the input
- responsive design, you can rotate the smartphone and it still looks cool :cool:
- 4 or 8 input length
- moreâ€¦
