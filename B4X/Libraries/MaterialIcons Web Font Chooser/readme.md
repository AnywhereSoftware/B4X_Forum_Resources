This is an icon chooser tool for the MaterialIcons Web font: <https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Webfont>  
This font includes 3595 icons. The built-in material icons font includes about 800 icons.  
  
Click on an icon to copy it to the clipboard. There are two options:  
  
1. Copy with Chr() - this should be used when using the icon in B4J code, B4i code or B4A code.  
2. Copy directly - this should be in B4A designer after you set the font:

As you can see the icon will appear as an empty square in the IDE, however it will work.  
  
You can change the icons color in the chooser. This only affects the icons as they are displayed in the chooser.  
Example project with the chooser: [www.b4x.com/b4j/files/WebFont.zip](https://www.b4x.com/b4j/files/WebFont.zip)
