###  [XUI] [B4XLib] SD TextView by Star-Dust

[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/121178/)

I needed to develop a modern editText (or TextField), but different from the B4XFloatTextField, different in terms of graphics and style. So I created the SD\_TextView  
(see also [**xComboBox**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-sd_xcombobox.135359/))
