**[SIZE=5]UPDATE: V. 2.00 (please, read [/SIZE]**[SIZE=5][**this post**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-b4xlib-lmvbstrfuncs.131973/post-976102)[/SIZE]**[SIZE=5]).[/SIZE]  
  
  
B4XLib that provides 12 VB6/VBA string functions.**  
  
Being a B4XLib, you can use it in B4A, B4J, B4i and is possible to read/modify the source code.  
  
I have decided to develop only those for which there are no analogues or identical in B4X.  
  
  
Remember that we spend time developing, during which we drink coffees, so offer me at least one :)  
  
String functions:  

- **Instr**
- **InStrRev**
- **Join**
- **Left**
- **LTrim**
- **Mid**
- **Replace**
- **Right**
- **RTrim**
- **Space**
- **Split**
- **StrReverse**
