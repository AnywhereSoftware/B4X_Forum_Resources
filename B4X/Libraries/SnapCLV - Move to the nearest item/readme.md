SnapCLV is a very simple class that adds a "snap" feature to xCLV in vertical mode. When the user stops scrolling the list the list scrolls to the nearest item so the top item will not be partially hidden.  
  
It is compatible with B4A, B4i and B4J  
  
Note that you need to call snap.ScrollChanged from the ScrollChanged event.
