**It is not recommented to use this class in B4J, the textsize is resetting without reasonsâ€¦**  
  
this class is based on the [Original Class](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/custom-view-autotextsizelabel.30642/) from [USER=1]@Erel[/USER].  
It works on B4A, B4I and B4J.  
I tested it with B4A and B4I.
