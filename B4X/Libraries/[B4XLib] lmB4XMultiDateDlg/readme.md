[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/164249/)

Crossplatform (B4A, B4J, B4i) library that provides a template (lmB4XDateTemplate2) to use with B4XDateDialog to highlight N dates (and make them clickable).  
It is very useful for developing SW for appointments, notes, reservations, schedulers, reminders, â€¦  
  
**For more information, see this thread:**

*Note: I don't have Apple HW and therefore neither B4i. The library contains a layout file for each platform; the B4i one was created for me by [USER=77305]@Sagenut[/USER] (thanks, my friend) but with an old version of B4i. If it doesn't work, open this B4XLib (it's a zip file) and replace it with one created by you (as already written in that thread, it will be very easy to do).
