This view is oriented to the [ios stepper view.](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/stepper)  
  
I spend a lot of time in creating views, like this and to create a high quality view cost a lot of time. If you want to support me and further views, then you can do it [here by Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=PBJGJWDDSM6ZG). :)
