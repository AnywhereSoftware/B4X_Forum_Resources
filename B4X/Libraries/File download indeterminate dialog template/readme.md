Just a bit of fun for a project, this is a simple animated dialog template with nothing more than the standard view animations and FontAwesome..  
  
I cannot create a b4i layout but it should be simple a matter of extracting and copying either of the layouts from the appropriate IDE to the b4i designer and adding it to the b4xlib.

FDI.B4a and FDI.b4j contain demo projects,  
FileDownloadIndeterminate.b4xlib is the library  
FileDownloadIndeterminate.xml is the documentation file which you can view with [Builddocs](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-library-documentation-viewer.112771/post-703249) or other library viewer.  
  
**Version 1.1**  

- Added an optional Complete dialog which displays the duration of the download and the Dialog buttons for options.
