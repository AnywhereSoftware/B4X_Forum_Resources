Hi Fam

I am proud to present the **B4X Daisy UI Kit**, a suite of native custom views designed to bring the modern aesthetic and utility of the **DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS)** framework to B4X development.  
Unlike libraries that wrap WebViews to achieve modern UI looks, **these components are 100% native**. They use B4XCanvas and standard Panels to render vector shapes, shadows, and layouts, ensuring high performance and a native feel on Android (and B4X cross-platform implementations).  
  
🎨 The Core: B4XDaisyVariants  
At the heart of this library is the B4XDaisyVariants static code module. It acts as the "glue" for the entire system, standardizing:  
  
• **Color Palettes:** Define semantic colors (Primary, Secondary, Accent, Success, Error) once, and all components adapt automatically.  
• **Shape Masks:** Mathematical generation of complex shapes like Squircles, Hexagons, Hearts, and Stars—no bitmap masks required.  
• **Size & Shadow Tokens:** Translates Tailwind-style tokens (e.g., w-12, shadow-xl) into native dip values.  
  
**What's in Version 0.1 - 17 Feb 2026 (ALPHA VERSION)**

📦 Included Components  
**1. B4XDashboard** A fully responsive, launcher-style grid.  
• **Auto-Grid:** Automatically calculates rows and columns based on screen size.  
• **Features:** Swipe pagination, notification badges (99+), and "snap-to-page" scroll physics.  
**2. B4XDaisyChat & ChatBubble** A complete chat controller and rendering engine.  
• **Logic:** Handles message history, "Time-Ago" timestamp formatting (e.g., "5m ago"), and read receipts.  
• **Visuals:** Vector-drawn bubbles with tails, supporting "Block" or "Rounded" styles and dynamic theming.  
**3. B4XDaisyAvatar** A smart image container.  
• **Masking:** Apply any shape (Squircle, Decagon, Star) to a profile picture.  
• **Status:** Built-in "Online" (green dot) and "Offline" indicators with automatic ring borders.  
**4. B4XDaisyStack** A layout container for depth effects.  
• **Depth:** Stacks items on top of each other with configurable offsets (StepPrimary, StepSecondary) to create "card stack" visuals.  
• **Auto-Fill:** Automatically resizes child views to fit the stack layers.  
**5. B4XDaisyDiv** A versatile container inspired by HTML divs.  
• **Styling:** Supports complex borders (dashed, groove, ridge, inset) and shadow elevations.  
  
PS: The components will be converted into a b4xlib soon enough..  
  
We have used these libraries in b4a so long
