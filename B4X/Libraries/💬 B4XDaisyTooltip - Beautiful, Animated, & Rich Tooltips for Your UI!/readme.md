Hi Fam  
  
I'm excited to share **B4XDaisyTooltip**, a brand new, highly customizable custom view for your B4A projects. Part of the DaisuyUIKit group, this component allows you to effortlessly attach dynamic, animated tooltips to any target B4XView.

Whether you need a simple informational hint or a complex custom pop-up containing badges and buttons, B4XDaisyTooltip handles it beautifully.  
  
**✨ Key Features:**  
• **9 DaisyUI Color Variants:** Choose from neutral, primary, secondary, accent, info, success, warning, or error to match your app's theme perfectly.  
• **Smart Placement:** Anchor your tooltips to the top, bottom, left, or right of any target view.  
• **Rich Custom Content:** Go beyond simple text! Use SetCustomContent(View As B4XView) to inject complex layouts (like panels containing badges or images) directly into the tooltip body.  
• **Highly Configurable:** Includes designer properties for ShowArrow (to display the pointer tail), ClickToClose, and TextWrapped (for multi-line text support).  
• **Simple Integration:** Just drop it in the designer or initialize it in code, and attach it to your view using AttachToTarget(TargetView).
