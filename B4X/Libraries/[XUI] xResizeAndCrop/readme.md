The xResizeAndCrop Class is a B4X libary.  
Current version 1.8  
  
It works on all three platforms: B4A, B4i and B4J.  
The xResizeAndCrop.b4xlib and the xResizeAndCrop.xml files are attached.  
You need to copy the xResizeAndCrop.b4xlib file to the AdditionlLibraries\B4X folder!  
  
**Donâ€™t copy the xResizeAndCrop.xml file to the AdditionalLibraries folder**, copy it in another folder for all b4xlib xml files.  
Example: AdditionlLibraries\B4XlibXMLFiles  
The xResizeAndCrop.xml file is for help purposes and is useful with the B4X [Help Viewer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-help-viewer.46969/) or the [B4XObjectBrowser](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-b4i-b4j-and-b4r-api-documentation-b4x-object-browser.25682/#content).  
The xResizeAndCrop.xml was generated with this tool: [b4xlib - XML generation](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xml2map-simple-way-to-parse-xml-documents.74848/)  
  
It is an evolution of the B4A project: [Resize and crop image](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/resize-and-crop-image.95001/#content).  
To make a B4X CustomView was inspired by this thread: [[B4X] [XUI] CropView.](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-cropview.94952/#content)  
  
The demo program is a B4XPages project for all three platforms.  
Tested on PC, Android Samsung S6, iPhone 6.  
  
EDIT: 2023.03.28 Version 1.8  
Added the code to load an image for B4i.  
  
EDIT: 2023.03.28 Version 1.7  
Set the crop window to the entire image when the width / height ratio is NONE  
Only the xResizeAndCrop.b4xlib and the xResizeAndCrop.xml files have been replaced.  
  
EDIT: 2022.06.26 Version 1.6  
Added Circle and round corner crop  
Added RoundCorner and CornerRadius properties.  
The libary needs the BitmapCreator library.  
  
EDIT: 2020.07.15 Version 1.5  
Added the HandleDotWidth property  
  
EDIT: 2020.07.15 Version 1.4  
Amended error with CroppedImage without a CroppedView.  
  
EDIT: 2020.06.25 Version 1.3  
Updated the Tag property according to Erels recommendation:

EDIT: 2019.03.12 Version 1.2  
Added WidthHeightRatio and WidthHeightRatioValue properties  
defining fixed or custom Width / Height ratios for the cropped image  
Added RotateImage method, original image rotation.  
  
EDIT: 2019.01.30 Version 1.1  
Added a Square property.  
When Square = True then the resized image is always square.
