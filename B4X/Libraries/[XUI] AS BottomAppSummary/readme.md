[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/166400/)

This library makes it easy to quickly show the 3 or 4 most important functions of the app to the user during their first launch, as part of the onboarding process â€” based on the [AS\_AppSummary](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-appsummary.158433/), built into a ready to use bottom menu. It can also be used as an update log to highlight key changes after a major update.  
  
You need:  

- [AS\_DraggableBottomCard](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-draggable-bottom-card.121219/) **V1.14+**
- [AS\_AppSummary](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-appsummary.158433/) **V2.02+**

I spend a lot of time in creating views, like this and to create a high quality view cost a lot of time.
