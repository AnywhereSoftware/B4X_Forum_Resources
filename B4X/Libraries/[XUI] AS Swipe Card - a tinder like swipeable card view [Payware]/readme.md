Hello Community,  
  
This library is **not free**, because, it cost a lot of time and gray hair to create such views.  
<https://payhip.com/b/ma7bR>  
Thanks for your understanding. :)  
  
This library is compatible and tested with **B4A**,**B4I** and **B4J**!  
If you have bugs or a wish then tell me it in the comments.  
  
**Features**  

- cross-platform compatible
- enable or disable events
- add and remove cards
- scroll to cards
- animations
- swipe with fingers
- and moreâ€¦

On B4J and B4I you need a base panel, only this way the events can be triggered by your other control elements, see the example projects to learn more.
