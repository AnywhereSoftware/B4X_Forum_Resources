[B4X]A Hierarchial Class Generator

If you have a class structure described as follows:



And you want to be able to do this in all Platforms:



You can achieve this manually, but the process has many repetitive parts, and it can be frustrating.
So here is a 'classGenerator' class that displays the class tree as a graph and generates the necessary classes.
They are saved in the parent directory of a B4XPages project, so that they can be easily added as Existing Modules.
The Log will have the two sections that are needed for the B4XMainPage (one in Class_Global and one in Initialize)


Notes:
1. You can look at each class and add Class-specific Methods and Delegates to other Methods
2. You can remove "setters" to make properties read-only (i.e. equivalent to Constants)
3. You can remove "getters" to limit access to properties
4. The 'New' Subs take advantage of the fact that classes can spawn instances of themselves - this avoids endless initializations
5. The generator class displays class trees in B4J and B4A, but since it accesses the project folder, classes should be generated in B4J
6. The demo shows a relatively 'Simple' tree, but it generates 8 classes with a total of 582 lines of code
7. Please use (or not) any or all of these techniques in any way you like.

Comments are welcome.
