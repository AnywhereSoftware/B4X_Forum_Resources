The project started from a request [HERE](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dart-board.168747/).  
It is a B4XPages project.  
  
Current version 1.2  
  
Attached the xDartboardV1\_2.zip file with the project and the xDartboard.b4xlib file.  
You must copy the xDartboard.b4xlib fille into the AdditionlLibraries\B4X folder.  
And check it in the IDE in the Libraries Manager Tab  
It depends on the BitmapCreator library (BitmapCreator, iBitmapCreator, jBitmapCreator).  
  
The program draws a dart board.   
When you touch it and move over it, it returns the index of the ring and the number of the sector of the touch point.
