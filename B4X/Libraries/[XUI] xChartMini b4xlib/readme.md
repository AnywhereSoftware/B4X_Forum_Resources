###  [XUI] xChartMini b4xlib by klaus

[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/146592/)

**Current version : 1.5**  
  
xChartMini is a b4xlib library, it is a minimalist version of the [xChartLite](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-xchartlite-b4xlib.140197/#content) library which is a lite version of the full [xChart](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-xchart-class-and-b4xlib.91830/#content) library.  
  
It has automatic scales, which can also be set manually.  
Automatic text size according to the chart size.  
  
I am convinced that many user do not need all kind of different possible charts and settings.  
The size of the code is a little bit more than the half of the xChartLite version and about one fifth of the full version.  
  
Supported charts:  
- Bar  
- Stacked bar  
- Lines  
  
The demo project is a B4XPages project using the xChartMini library.  
Tested on PC, Android Samsung S10, Samsung Tab S2, iPhone 8 and iPad.  
**xChartMiniDemoV1\_0.zip** B4XPages cross platform project using the xChartMini library.  
**xChartMini.b4xlib** The xChartMini B4X library file. You must copy it into your your AdditionalLibraries\B4X folder.  
**xChartMini.xml** Help file, it is useful with the B4X [Help Viewer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-help-viewer.46969/) or the [B4XObjectBrowser](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-b4i-b4j-and-b4r-api-documentation-b4x-object-browser.25682/#content).  
**Donâ€™t copy the xChartMini.xml file to the AdditionalLibraries folder!**
