Hi Fam  
  
I’m excited to introduce **B4XDaisyToast**, a robust, cross-platform custom view class designed to bring modern, DaisyUI-inspired toast notifications to your B4A, B4i, and B4J applications.  
Whether you need a quick success message or a persistent error alert, this component handles it all gracefully with built-in stacking and animations.

**✨ Key Features:**  
• **Four Built-in Variants:** Easily trigger Success, Info, Warning, or Error alerts with just one line of code.  
• **Highly Configurable Positioning:** Control exactly where your notifications appear. Set HorizontalAlignment (start, center, end) and VerticalAlignment (top, middle, bottom).  
• **Timed Auto-Dismissal with Progress Bars:** You can set a duration for the notification to remain on screen. If you enable ShowProgress, a sleek progress bar will visually tick down the remaining time.  
• **Smart Stacking:** Multiple notifications won't overlap! The component automatically stacks messages with appropriate gaps and handles layout animations seamlessly.  
• **Interactive Dismissal:** Users can manually click on an alert to detach/dismiss it instantly.  
**🚀 Quick Usage Example:** It's incredibly easy to integrate. Attach the toast container to your page's root, and then simply call the variant methods:
