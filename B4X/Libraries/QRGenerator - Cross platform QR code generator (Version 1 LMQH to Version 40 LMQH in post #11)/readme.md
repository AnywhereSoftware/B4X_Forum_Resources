[B4X Forum - B4X - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/116891/)

This is based on [USER=1]@Erel[/USER]'s posting here:  
  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-qrgenerator-cross-platform-qr-code-generator.93092/>  
  
Have added all the required generator polynomial factors that are required for Version 1 to Version 40 QR Codes  
Changed the names of the array holding the generator polynomial factors to:  

```B4X

Have added additional "setup code" in Sub Initialize(â€¦.) so that it can support **Version 1 to Version 10 QR Codes for all 4 error correction levels (i.e Levels L, M, Q, H)**  
  
As it stands at present it supports:  
1. Version 1 to 10 QR Code (error correction level L, M, Q, H)  
2. Version 23H  
3. Version 40H  
4. Version 40L  
  
Sample code that I have added/amended/changed:
