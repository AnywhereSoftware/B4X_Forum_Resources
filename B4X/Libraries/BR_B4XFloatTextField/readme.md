Hello everyone!  
With the example of Erel library and with the help of [Biswajit](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/members/biswajit.100215/), we made some modifications to the original B4XFloatTextField library, recreating it with some modifications in the visual transforming into BR\_B4XFloatTextField.  
  
See how the example looked:  
Note: I have no iphone to be able to test. so I only tested it on B4A and B4J.  
  
The first two fields are the original ones (B4XFloatTextField), all the others are the modified ones (BR\_B4XFloatTextField).
