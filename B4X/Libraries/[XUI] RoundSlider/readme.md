**Latest version is included in XUI Views: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/100836/#content>**  
  
Cross platform round slider.  
  
Add it with the designer. Make sure that its width and height are the same. Make the custom view large enough as the custom view size includes the place for the thumb.
