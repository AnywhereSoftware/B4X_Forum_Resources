Generate Html with B4X code.  
  
GitHub: <https://github.com/pyhoon/MiniHtml2-B4X>  
  
Note: This library is not backward compatible with code generated with MiniHtml library v0.XX.  
  
Reason for a new version:  
The previous version used modules as a shortcut to create Tag object. The modules name has some conflicts with other libraries such as p for period and Tr for TextReader.
