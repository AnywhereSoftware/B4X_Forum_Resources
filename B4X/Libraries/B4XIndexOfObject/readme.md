Multi-platform library (B4A, B4J, B4i) that provides only one very useful method: **Find**.  
  
Its purpose is to be able to obtain the index of a List like the IndexOf method easily even if the elements contained in the List are objects and not simple strings or numbers.  
  
Furthermore, it also works with Maps, returning the key relating to the object contained in them and searched for.  
  
**[See post #2]**  
  
[For example, it would have been useful in [this case](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/does-list-contains-map.159909/)].  
  
  
B4X Library and example project attached.
