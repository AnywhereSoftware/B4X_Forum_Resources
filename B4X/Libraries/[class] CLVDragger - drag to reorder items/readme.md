This is a class module for B4A from modified Erel's B4J clas CLV Dragger from this thread: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/solved-class-modified-b4j-class-clvdragger-for-b4a.120358/>  
  
Usage:  
- Call dragger.SetDefaults(width, backgroundColor, textColor) Since it is used on the phone with fingers to drag and move, I thought it will be good to be able to set the "dragger" width, background color and text color.  
- Call dragger.AddDragButtons to add the drag button.  
- Call dragger.RemoveDragButtons to remove the buttons.  
  
Depends on XUI , xCustomListView (1.72+) and Reflection library  
  
See attached example and a class module file:
