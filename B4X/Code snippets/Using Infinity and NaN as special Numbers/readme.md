This is an addendum to his posting to show how these two objects are both numbers and not numbers, and how to test for that.  

```B4X
Private Sub specialNumbers  
   
    'Infinity behaves in the expected way as as an infinitely large number  
    Dim infinity As Double = 1 / 0  
    Log(infinity = -Logarithm(0, cE))        'True  
    Log((infinity = infinity))                      'True  
    Log((infinity = -infinity))                    'False  
    Log(TAB)  
  
    Log((infinity + 5))                       'Infinity  
    Log((infinity - 5))                        'Infinity  
    Log((infinity * 5))                        'Infinity  
    Log((infinity / 5))                        'Infinity
