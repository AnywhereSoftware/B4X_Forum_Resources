I often needed to turn a PDF into an image, most of the time to have it printed on a thermal printer.  
I was looking for simple and cross-platform methods.  
  
This is an example that allows you to get an image with Windows / Android / iOs from a PDF file  
  
  
**NB.** For Windows it is necessary to download a Jar, while for Android a library as indicated below. For iOs it does not require extra libraries
