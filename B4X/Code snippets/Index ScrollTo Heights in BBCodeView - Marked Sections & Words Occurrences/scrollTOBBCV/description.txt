There is a on-the-fly search method created by @T201016
https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/solved-bbcodeview-scrolling-the-page-to-the-word-position.143556/

In my snippet, indexing is done once (in the attached example about 500 msec)
The example has under 200 lines of code (incl. the sample text).

Method:
1. Insert invisible markers between sections and measure height to each marker.
2. Index words by marker height.
 
Use the code in any way you like.
