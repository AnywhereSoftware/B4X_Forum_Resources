I have long hoped that an Alert would be added in the IDE environment when someone writes a new message or there are new ALERTS for me.  
  
Since my wish did not come true, I wanted to make it happen by myself. Here is a source that works on all platforms that scans over a period of time for new messages or ALERTS.  
For the moment I use the polling method.  
  
I attach only the example in B4J, but as soon as possible I will publish a version for B4A and B4i, even if the class is written for B4X and you can use it anyway on any platform.

PS. For the B4A version I was thinking of a floating App that remains running in the Background.
