###  Create CustomListView items by LucaMs

[B4X Forum - B4X - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/168767/)

Tired of repeating the same code over and over again, especially when developing a sample project for other members, I thought I'd create this snippet. It's imperfect, but it's still useful.  
  
**B4X, then for B4A, B4J, B4i.  
  
Update**:  
I implemented [USER=123281]@PaulMeuris[/USER]'s suggestions ([post #5](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-create-customlistview-items.168767/post-1034641)), they're good.  
  
I need to read (reread) the tutorial about Snippets, because I can't set the focus on the lblItem to allow editing of that "field." Maybe it's not possible, maybe it can be done on a single field (CustomListView1 in this case).
