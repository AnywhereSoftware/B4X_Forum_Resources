Hi everyone, recently i needed to implement an double column list in one of my app.  
I was ispired by an [USER=1]@Erel[/USER] [example](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/xcustomlistview-with-four-columns-of-imageviews-and-many-rows.101431/#post-636920), but i needed something slightly different, so i did this (i want to share with you, maybe could be useful to someone even if is a simple thing):

(it support odd number of elements, i adapted it to work with two columns, but you can simply edit some little functions to add other columns)
