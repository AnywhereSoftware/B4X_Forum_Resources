Hi Fam  
  
[Github Repo](https://github.com/Mashiane/SithasoApex---ApexCharts-More-Simplified)  
  
I've had my eye on this [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/) Charting Framework for a while as it has some of the most beautiful and easy to use charts. However, after being impressed with how simple [ChartKick](https://github.com/ankane/chartkick.js) is (a chart with a simple line of code), I wanted something similar. So here is the plan… we have done 10 chart types so far…
