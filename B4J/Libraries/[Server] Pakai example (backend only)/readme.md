This is an example project generated from [**Pakai framework**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/project-template-pakai-framework.167080/) project template **without frontend**.  
Hence the project is smaller to start with.  
You can then use other tools like Curl, Postman or any API testing client to test the API endpoints.  
  
The API endpoints example included are categories, products and find.  
You can add your own API and remove these 3 server handlers.
