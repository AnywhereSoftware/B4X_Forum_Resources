This is a wrap of the [jAsioHost](https://github.com/mhroth/jasiohost) library on Github. To work it also requires inline Java which can be found in the example project [jAsio audio . SimpleMixer](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jasio-audio-simple-mixer-windows-only.142781/)  
  
It also requires additional downloads. See the example project for a full explanation.
