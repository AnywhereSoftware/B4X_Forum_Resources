Still remember [**MinimaList API Server**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/project-template-web-minimalist-api-server.160679/)?  
  
Features:  

- It is now based on to **Pakai** with all the features like JSON and XML support
- MinimaList API Server uses MinimaListUtils instead of MiniORMUtils library
- **MinimaList** is a library for working with Maps inside a List
- **No database** is required
- but you can persist the data using **KeyValueStore** library

This example has been created using [**Inti Server**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/project-template-inti-server-v1.167212/) template (a lightweight template based on Pakai v4.00)  
Note: It is a quick example and is not well tested.   
Surprisingly, it seems working very well with MinimaList library v1.07 which has not been updated for a while.
