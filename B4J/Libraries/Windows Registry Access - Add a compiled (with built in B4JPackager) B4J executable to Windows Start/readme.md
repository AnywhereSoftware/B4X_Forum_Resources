Good morning everyone,  
  
I needed a way to start an application in windows startup so I created this library. The compiled library is contained in NHRegistry.zip and a sample project with examples on how to use it (also containing the code of the library) is contained in MyRegistry.zip. It requires jShell library and works only with windows not breaking the code in other OSs.  
  
Have a pleasant day
