This is a wrap of code found here, <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-show-page-loading-div-until-the-page-has-finished-loading/>  
  
Thanks to alwaysbusy advise [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-solved-how-to-trap-the-readychange-event-of-the-document-to-get-the-readystate.118519/#post-741743).  
  
NB: Please note that no js or css resource was loaded here. BANano V5 is coming with a new way to handle preloaded and this will be updated accordingly! Ta  
  
You can then hide the loader anytime you want by calling one of the methods or "uncomment" the javascript lines to hide it as soon as the page load is "complete".
