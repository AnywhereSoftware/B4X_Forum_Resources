SithasoDaisy5 is a wrap of the MIT based [DaiyUI](https://daisyui.com) [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) Component library to be used on top of [BANano](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-banano-website-app-pwa-library-with-abstract-designer-support.99740/#content) to bring you the best of worlds when creating your websites and webapps.  
  
**Why we chose DaisyUI…  
  
Supercharges Tailwind CSS**  
  
DaisyUI takes the power of Tailwind and simplifies it with pre-built, customizable components. You get the best of both worlds: the utility-first approach of Tailwind and the rapid prototyping ability of a component library.  
  
**Ready-to-Use Components**  
With DaisyUI, you have access to a wide range of components like buttons, cards, modals, alerts, and more. These are pre-styled, responsive, and look amazing right out of the box.  
  
**Themeable by Design**  
DaisyUI makes theming effortless. Whether you’re building a light or dark mode, or customizing your brand's palette, DaisyUI supports themes with simple, intuitive configuration.  
  
**Customizable**  
Unlike rigid libraries, DaisyUI components are built with Tailwind classes, so you can easily tweak them to fit your exact design needs without fighting against predefined styles.  
  
**Developer-Friendly**  
Its intuitive syntax is easy to learn and integrate, even for teams new to Tailwind CSS. Plus, it's well-documented, making the development process smooth and hassle-free.  
  
**Lightweight & Performant**  
No unnecessary bloat. DaisyUI is lightweight, keeping your bundle sizes in check and your app’s performance top-notch.  
  
**Active Community and Regular Updates**  
Backed by a vibrant community and maintained actively, DaisyUI is always evolving with the latest best practices and features.  
  
Why reinvent the wheel when you can save time, effort, and resources? With DaisyUI, you can build modern, responsive, and stunning web applications faster than ever.  
  
Don’t just take our word for it—try it out today and experience the difference!, <https://daisyui.com/>  
  
Now, using the b4j abstract designer, you can now enjoy all the DaisyUI functionality using your favorate IDE. You drag and drop components, set up properties and using LoadLayout, are able to see your UI in no time, just the way you designed it.  
  
There is still a long way to go though before we finalize SDV5.  
  
**What's New?**  
  
1. SithasoDaisy5 is a **NEW** b4xlib and not an update to SithasoDaisy2.  
2. SithasoDaisy5 is **NOT** backward compatible with SithasoDaisy2.  
3. The component names start with **SDUI5.**  
4. This b4xlib cannot be used in Production Apps as yet. Things might change and code cleanups will be done.  
5. FontAwesome is no longer used, for icons one should use SVG icon files.  
6. Supports both Abstract Designer & Code for building the UI. The abstract designer is a low code mode of creating your UI whilst writing code to create the UI can be cumbersome. To ease this one uses getters and setters. These getters and setters match 99% of the names used in the DaisyUI documentation.  
7. Works well with the latest version of BANano i.e. 9+  
8. **SithasoDaisy5 is** **OPEN-SOURCE**, compared to all the previous versions of SithasoDaisy. All previous versions of SithasoDaisy are commercial products.
