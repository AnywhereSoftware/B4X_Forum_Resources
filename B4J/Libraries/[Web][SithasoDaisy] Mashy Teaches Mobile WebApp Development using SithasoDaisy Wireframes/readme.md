- The first beta (tryout) version of SithasoDaisy Wireframes it out. Catch it [here](https://terabox.com/s/19BXJACt_UYztLm4bK1jncg)
- Download, unzip the file and double click the ".bat" file to start the app.

  
First, think **Abstract Designer.**  
  
The same steps indicated here are the same steps you will take when using the abstract designer. You will achieve the same outcomes.  
  
You have (a) a tree view that shows how your HTML tree looks like, (2) properties to change an elements properties (just like in the abstract designer) and (3) resources - images and files you will use in your project.
