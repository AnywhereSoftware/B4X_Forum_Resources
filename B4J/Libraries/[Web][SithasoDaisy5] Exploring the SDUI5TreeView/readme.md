Hi Fam

DaisyUI TreeView is a customizable tree view component that supports features like drag-and-drop, inline editing, multi-selection, and dynamic node management. It allows developers to create interactive and accessible tree structures. The SDUI5TreeView is a new custom component added to SithasoDaisy5. It uses the menu, checkbox and input components. This is now part of SD5. This has been built from the ground-up using Github Copilot as an ES6 component.
