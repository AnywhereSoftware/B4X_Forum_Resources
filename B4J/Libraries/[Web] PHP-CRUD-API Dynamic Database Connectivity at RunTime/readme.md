Hi Fam  
  
With just a few tweaks, one is able to use the [php-crud-api](https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api) to access different databases at runtime. I have updated the api.php file to use HEADERS to ensure that this happens.  
  
One needs to include these headers for the api.php file. NB. Please note the X-API-Key for the authorization key.
