Hello All,  
Here is my OpenAI library and example code to interface with the library. I started this on August 11.  
I started with the library from Blueforcer here: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-openai-a-i-text-image-generation.159877/>  
His example code there was copyrighted. His library code was not.  
I have included none of his example code. Thus, my example code is free for anyone to use as is the library. My library is not backwards compatible with his.  
  
I am not a very experienced programmer so I hope everyone finds it acceptable. It all works correctly as is, but there is so much coming from OpenAI that I can't keep up.  
I welcome help in continuing this library.  
  
Attached you will find my example code: OAIUtils.zip and the OpenAI library.  
  
I have added a todo list at the bottom of the example code if anyone is interested. Please post in this thread if you take on any todo items or other improvements to the library or example code so no one else will duplicate your effort.  
I will help all I can if anyone has questions. I have learned way more than I ever thought I would about OpenAI.  
I think the library will work with B4A, but I am not sure. I have not tested that.  
  
I have uploaded the Objects folder as well. This is because I can't write to File.Exists(DirApps, FileName). So, I had to put files that the program requires in a folder that could be easily found. Again, if anyone has a better way for me to do this stuff, please let me know.
