Hi there,  
  
I am sharing my example Google Image Downloader using Selenium and to be more specific Pnd\_Selenium lib (from Pendrush) that you can find here:

you will also need the followingâ€¦

Before run, add chrome for automating/testing and chrome driver into one folder (name the folder chrome - into it will be [chrome.exe/all](http://chrome.exe/all) folder need/and chromedriver.exe, under objects folder)

<https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/131.0.6778.204/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip>  
  
This is also a small example of customlistview, designerutils, base64 decoding, image to bytes  
  
Enjoy!  
Happy new year!!!
