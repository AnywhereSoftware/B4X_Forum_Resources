Hi Fam  
  
Perhaps an illustration can help.

**Conclusion: Reaching the same goal**  
  
Let me explain..  
  
1. Anyone who wants to develop Server WebApps, has 2 options with Alain's tools, these are [ABMaterial](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-abmaterial-framework-for-webapps.60072/#content) / [BANano (Server)](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-banano-website-app-pwa-library-with-abstract-designer-support.99740/#content).  
2. ABMaterial does not use an abstract designer (layouts) to create the UI, however BANAnoServer does.  
3. ABMaterial uses MaterializeCSS for the UI and one codes the UI etc.  
4. BANanoServer can use any frontend framework, for example, there is SithasoDaisy that uses TailwindCSS & BANanoVuetifyAD3 which used materialize framework but for VueJS. One can use any framework then want, no limit, nada.  
5. Both ABMaterial & BANanoServer apps are deployed on a VPS and will do the same thing.  
6. Both ABMaterial & BANanoServer use the same code base, will do the same thing, the only difference is the UI creation part.  
  
Anyone can add more into my attempt to clarify this as I am basic my explanation on my current understanding.  
  
Enjoy!
