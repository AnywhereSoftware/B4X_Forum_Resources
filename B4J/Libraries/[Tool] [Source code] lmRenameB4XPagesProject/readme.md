A tool to rename B4XPages project files.  
  
As you know, a typical B4XPages project looks something like this:

If you want to change the project name, you need to manually rename 6 files - 2 for each platform - and the "main root folder" if desired (very often).  
In particular, you know how tedious it is to rename "meta" files, because of the double dot.  
  
With this tool you can do it automatically and without the risk of making mistakes.  
  
Just select the B4XPages project folder, enter the new name and press [Rename].
