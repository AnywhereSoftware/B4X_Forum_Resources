There are two untils class on this library:  
- jtime4x: The class method which Until has alot date time functions.  
- jDate (): The class has obligations to convert date time types to string, long,â€¦

    Log("Last 24 day ago: " & jdtt.toString)  
        
    jdtt.JavaDate  = jtime4x.getNDaysAgo(10, "dd/MM/yyyy")  
    Log("Next 10 day: " & jdtt.toString)  
    
    Dim jnow As jtime4x  
    
    jdtt.JavaDate  = jtime4x.plusMonths(jnow.ConvertDate(2023,5,15), 2)  
    Log("Plus 2 month: " & jdtt.toString)
