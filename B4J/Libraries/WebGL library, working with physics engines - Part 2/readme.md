Hi all,  
  
this is the second part of WebGL library physics engines demos.  
  
Before compile it, you have to download the [Resources1.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17KZPfbhSP1aPzcUE1PIniktO2FgtpJz_/view?usp=sharing) file, rename it to Resources.zip  
and put it in the project Asset folder. It is not big, but I'm unable to post here.  
  
On this project there are two different scenes, launch it by default with Scene1.  
When you want to try the other demo, uncomment the line with Scene2 (line 60) and  
comment the one with Scene1, then recompile and the other scene will be loaded.  
  
As always, copy the scene URL in the log (in magenta color) and paste it to your browser to load the scene.  
  
In scene1 I dded a slider to move the world gravity. Try to move it in particular under zero point to see the effect.  
  
I hope you will study the code so you can change somethingâ€¦.  
  
Enjoy
