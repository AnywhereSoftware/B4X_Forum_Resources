**[SIZE=5]Inti[/SIZE]**[SIZE=5] - Core of Pakai framework[/SIZE]  
This is a very minimum server template (7KB), without dependencies of any library (except for jServer).  
  
This template may not as useful as Pakai framework.  
However, it provides a very basic server configuration to start with.  
Instead of starting from Pakai and deleting all the unwanted stuffs one by one, sometimes it is best to start with a clean template.  
This is an alternative to my [MiniServer template](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/project-template-miniserver.150634/) (78KB).  
You can start by adding more libraries such as [WebApiUtils](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-webapiutils-v4.167012/) and [MiniORMUtils](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-miniormutils.166030/) or write everything from scratch.

Update: There is also a minimum example project (13KB) depends on WebApiUtils, MiniORMUtils and included sample handlers.
