This is a B4xlib customview that uses a textfield, label and the textformatter lib to provide formatting of a numeric text field with NumberFormat2.  
  
Once the textfield loses focus, the number is displayed with formatting defined in the custom view by overlaying a label.  
  
Click on the label to edit the text, you can also programmatically get and set the value using the B4xNFinput.text methods.  
  
The customview uses a layout so you can change it as you like if you unpack the lib.

The number format is modifiable in the designer on the customview but requires delimiting with a semicolon ";" rather than the number formats comma ",".
