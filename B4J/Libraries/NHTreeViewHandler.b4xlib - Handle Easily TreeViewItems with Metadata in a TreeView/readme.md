Goodevening to everyone,  
  
I created this class for me and since I believe it is very useful I upload it here. It is only for B4J and not B4X although it is a b4xlib so place it in {Additional Libs}\B4J - I use b4xlib to have also the Instructions sub in the class so I can start directly and remember everything after a lot of time.  
The class allows you to handle treeview control and add treeitems with connected metadata (a map of variables you want to accompany the treeitem which are retrievable).  
  
Enjoy
