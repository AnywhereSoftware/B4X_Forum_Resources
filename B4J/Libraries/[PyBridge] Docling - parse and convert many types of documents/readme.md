Docling is a large library. It requires VC++ 14 toolchain to be installed: <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>  
Look for the "Desktop development with C++" option.  
  
You will also need to enable "developer mode" in Windows setting for this library to run properly (or run the IDE as an administrator). It has something to do with the usage of symbolic links.  
  
There are many options in this library and it shouldn't be too difficult to extend this example and access more features.  
  
Example depends on <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jdraganddrop2-drag-and-drop.76168>
