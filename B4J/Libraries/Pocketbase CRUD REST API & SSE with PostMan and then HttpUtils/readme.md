Hi  
  
**CRUD Examples Attached  
  
PocketBase** is an open source backend consisting of embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions, built-in users management, convenient dashboard UI and simple REST-ish API.  
  
  
  
It runs on Linux, Windows and Mac, You can get it here, <https://pocketbase.io/>  
  
We will look at each offering using HTTPUtils, thus covering the REST API both with postman & b4x.  
  
Here we go.  
  
PS: Do not forget to start the server
