It is a shortcut wrap for [**this Github project**](https://github.com/cyberpartizan/Discrete-Fourier-transform-visualization). Will convert it to B4J when I have some time to do so.  
  
Attached:  
1. The jar - copy it to your B4J additional libs folder  
2. the B4J project - unzip it and then run it  
  
How to use:  
1. Click and hold down your mouse button and draw something (not visible) - let go of the mouse and it will draw your invisible drawing
