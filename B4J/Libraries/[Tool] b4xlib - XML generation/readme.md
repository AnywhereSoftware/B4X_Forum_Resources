### [Tool] b4xlib - XML generation by Erel
### 07/08/2020
[B4X Forum - B4J - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/101450/)

b4xlibs do not require an XML file. The IDE parses the packed code modules.  
With this tool you can generate the XML from the packed source code. It is useful for documentation purposes as there are tools that expect this XML.  
For example: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/java-auto-generate-library-documentation-with-xml2bb.18564/#content>  
  
The parser is not very sophisticated and will not always be 100% correct.  
  
Note that the XML files shouldn't be kept in the libraries folder as the IDE will show an error message about a missing jar file.  
  
Depends on jDragandDrop2.b4xlib: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jdraganddrop2-drag-and-drop.76168/#post-636391>  
And Archiver: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/21688/#content>  
  
Source code and executable jar are attached.  
  
**Updates**  
  
V1.23 - Fixes an issue where properties XML didn't include the information from both the setter and the getter.  
V1.22 - Fixes an issue where the return type of subs without parameters was not added. Thank you [USER=9800]@stevel05[/USER]!  
V1.21 - The full event signature is added.  
V1.20 - Class events are added to the XML.  
  
V1.10 - Manifest file is parsed and version and author fields are added to the XML.  
- The order of fields, which shouldn't really matter, was changed based on the order of fields of the XML generated by the doclet tool.  
- Last saved folder is stored in a settings file.
