Starting to test out the new Custom view for B4j, I decided to port the test I did for the B4a when customviews were first incorporated.  
  
So here it is, in addition it will also play the chord via midi.  
  
Updated to improve Gui, chord chart will resize.  
  
Requires B4j 4.2 Beta  
  
**Updated** to replace an old method for measure text which was deprecated in java a few years ago, and change method to play midi.
