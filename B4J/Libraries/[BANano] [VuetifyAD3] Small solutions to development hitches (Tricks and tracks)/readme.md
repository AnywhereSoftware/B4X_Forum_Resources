[B4X Forum - B4J - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/137667/)

At the request of several friends, I opened this Thread which explains some problems encountered when developing with Banano and VuetiiFy.  
  
Obviously I will propose the solutions that I have experimented, perhaps they will not be the best, but they are those obtainable with the documentation available at the moment.
