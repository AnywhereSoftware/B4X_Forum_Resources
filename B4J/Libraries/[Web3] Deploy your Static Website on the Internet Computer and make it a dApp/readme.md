Hi  
  
So I wanted to make SithasoDaisy Static Demo App a dApp, so that it runs on the [Internet Computer.](https://internetcomputer.org/)  
  
  
1. Create an account on fleek, [https://fleek.co](https://fleek.co/),  
2. Link your Github profile and then "Add a new site", selecting the Github Repo you want to publish. Choose **IC**

3. Then you will need to link to your Github account and select the repo that you want to deploy.  
  
I had to clean out my repo to clean out all all content so that only relevant content is available, especially the js and css files as these were compiled using a date stamp.  
  
So here you have it, SithasoDaisy Demo as a Decentralized App on top of Web3.

I'm yet to explore how this whole Internet Computer and Web3 works like.  
  
Happy Coding.
