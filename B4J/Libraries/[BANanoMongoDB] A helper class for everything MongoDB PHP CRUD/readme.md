Hi there  
  
Finally just managed to get this working. What a journeyâ€¦  
  
If you need MongoDB PHP CRUD, I got you. The structure of the code is also simple, you just initialize the class and then refer to the examples for an easy peasy experience.  
  
Here is a demo of what we have been able to do using our UI framework of choice. You can use this with Skeleton and any other framework.
