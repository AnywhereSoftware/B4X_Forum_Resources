Yes, I know, this is starting to sound like a real fruit basket thing ?  
  
BANanoPeer is a wrapper around the Peerjs library that allows you to make video/audio conferences with chat and sharing your screen via a browser.  
  
This is also a good library you can use e.g. for making multiplayer games.  
  
Attached is the b4xlib library with source code and the following demo:

**Notes:**  
1. To use this library, you will need to run it on **HTTPS**, as this is now required to do use the Webcam!  
2. For the demo I disabled audio as it got me in a real sound loopback because they were in the same room. You can re-active it, see the comments in the code.
