Hi [USER=22203]@Informatix[/USER]  
  
In a B4J app, I get this error in the Logs folder. Sorry, I've been unable to reproduce the error.  
  
Waiting for debugger to connectâ€¦  
Program started.

INFO: index exceeds maxCellCount. Check size calculations for class flm.b4j.treeviewextended.TreeViewExtended$MyTextFieldTreeCell  
  
Can you let me know what may cause this error?  
  
Regards,  
Mark Stuart
