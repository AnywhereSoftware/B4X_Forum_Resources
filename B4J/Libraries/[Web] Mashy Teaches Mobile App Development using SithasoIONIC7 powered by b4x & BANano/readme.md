Hi there  
  
[Open Demo on your CellPhone.](https://sithaso-ionic.vercel.app/)  
  
During the course of these lessons we will look at how we can create mobile apps using [Ionic 7](https://ionicframework.com/), powered by b4x and BANano.  
  
**NB: PLEASE DO NOT COMMENT OR ASK QUESTIONS ON THIS THREAD.** If you need to ask a question, please start a new thread with a prefix **[SithasoIONIC7] or** [go to this thread](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasoionic7-mobile-webapp-development-q-a.151982/)  
  
This [b4xlib](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasoionic7-ionic7-framework-mobilekit-powered-by-b4x-and-banano.149902/#content) is built using pure VanillaJS, no Angular, no Vue and no React or anything of that sort. What I love about Ionic is the almost 100% native look and feel to iOS and Android devices. Its just smooth. To develop our mobile apps, we will use coding and or the abstract designer. Both are supported anyway.  
  
Let's loop at some of the screens we will create for our apps below.  
  
1. [You will need BANano](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-website-app-pwa-library-with-abstract-designer-support.99740/#content)  
2. You need some knowledge of using the abstract designer, this however is not necessary if you follow the coding approach to creating UIs. It is however recommended that you always use the abstract designer.  
3. You will need to explore the Demo source code to learn more and also do some reading from the Ionic framework website.  
4. You will need SithasoIONIC7 b4x. [Get it from Paypal at $25 certificate of appreciation](https://paypal.me/anelembanga?country.x=ZA&locale.x=en_US)
