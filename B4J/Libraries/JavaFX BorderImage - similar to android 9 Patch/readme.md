Staying with the graphic theme, this is a wrap of the javafx class BorderImage and associated classes. It is like an Android 9 Patch for Javafx.

At a minimum you specify the image, border width, border Insets, and slice width. The methods in BorderImage\_Utils provide shortcuts to creating a border image. Or you can take full control and specify everything yourself if necessary.  
  
Documentation for the border image is here <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/layout/BorderImage.html>  
  
The example displays the screen in the image. All buttons have the same BorderImage. Button 3 gets resized when you resize the window.  
  
All the code is in the example project and a B4xLib is attached.  
  
Let me know how you get on with it.
