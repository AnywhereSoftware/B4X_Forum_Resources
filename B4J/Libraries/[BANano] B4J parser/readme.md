My compliments to [USER=974]@alwaysbusy[/USER] for this magnificent effort.  
  
It's very clever the way you post-create the javascript application from the B4J app. I have a question though, where did you manage to get hold of the lexer/parser for the B4J language? Is it published somewhere? Is B4J opensource?  
  
Thank you for that excellent library/framework.
