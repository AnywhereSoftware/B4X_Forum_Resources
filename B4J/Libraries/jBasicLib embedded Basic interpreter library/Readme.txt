Introduction
------------

Before extracting the jBasicLib.zip project file it should be  unlocked by right clicking on it in File Explorer, selecting Properties and checking Unblock at the lower right of the General tab otherwise the CHM help files will need to be individually unblocked.

The jBasicLib jar and xml files should be moved to your B4J Additional Libraries folder.

The jBasicLibDemo project demonstrates the main parts of the host interface to an instance of jBsicLib.


Help
----

Look in the Help folder in the project folder for more help. If the compiled help files will not display properly then the BasicIDE.zip file was not unlocked before extraction. Either go back and do that or individually unlock each help file.

BasicLib.chm documents the methods, properties and events implemented by the jBasicLib library object.

B4Script.chm documents the B4Script language implemented by the jBasicLib library object.
