When I started working with the Mermaid library I also discovered this nice mockup js library called wired.  
  
This lib is just for generating mockups/wireframes for anyone playful. We have 15 elements currently in the library. These are  
  
1. Input  
2. Toggle  
3. TextArea  
4. Radio / RadioGroup  
5. Spinner  
6. Slider  
7. Button  
8. FAB  
9. IconButton  
10. Tabs  
11. Cards  
12. Checkbox  
13. ListBox  
14. Progress  
15. Combo  
  
Let's look at each one below.  
  
PS: This is an extension of my experiments with Vue here, <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananovue-building-webapps-websites-with-vuejs.109579/#content> but you can tweak it to be independent of that.
