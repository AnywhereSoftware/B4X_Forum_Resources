Here is a port of AWS\_S3\_1\_1.zip of:  
  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/amazon-web-services-s3-v4-signature-calculator.81006/>  
  
The attached zip contains a code module that calculates V4 signatures for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) REST API requests, enabling creation of AWS S3 PUT/GET/DELETE requests.  
  
You basically just plug in the properties necessary for a signature calculation and call Signature.  
  
The accompanying example code has 4 worked examples that actually generate the signatures the AWS documentation says they should.  
  
There is extensive in-line documentation.  
  
I could never get:

working but am indebted to it for some hints in a couple of areas.  
  
NOTE: THIS VERSION OF THE CODE MODULE IS TRI CROSS PLATFORM (B4A, B4J and B4I).  
  
**NOTE: To use under B4J you need to copy the B4A Encryption and ByteConverter Additional Libraries to B4J.**

for practical ways to use the module with AWS S3 buckets - I will leave it to you to do the portingâ€¦  
  
**UPGRADE 1.7**  
  
Attached is version 1.7 which utilizes the new [GMTFormatter.B4Xlib](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-format-dates-in-gmt-time-zone-without-changing-the-apps-time-zone.129502/#content) to handle extraction of GMT without having to change time zones. The significance of this is that it means any B4A/i/J apps using it can run over day light saving change events and still have all DateTime.Date and DateTime.Time calls work correctly.
