[B4X Forum - B4J - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/168270/)

**FrostRabbitMQ** is a B4J wrapper for the [**RabbitMQ Java Client**](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client) that makes it easy for B4X developers to integrate AMQP messaging into their apps.  
With this library, you can connect to a RabbitMQ broker, declare queues/exchanges, publish messages, and consume messages.  
  
With FrostRabbitMQ, you can build scalable, event-driven applications.  
  
This library was built on top of the wonderful work of [USER=45973]@Magma[/USER]:
