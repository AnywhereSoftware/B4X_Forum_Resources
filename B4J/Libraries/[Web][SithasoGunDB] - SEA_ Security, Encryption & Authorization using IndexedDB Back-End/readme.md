Hi Fam  
  
[Demo on Vercel](https://sithaso-ionic-7-gun-db-sea.vercel.app/#/)  
  
Today we look at how we can perform user authentication using GunDB. GunDB uses localstorage / indexedDb / file / and other databases as back-ends through various adapted.  
The version that has been made available here uses IndexedDB as a back-end to store data from nodes.  
  
One is able to have user authentication in GunDB, this means, we can add users, sign in and sign out and also be able to store data on user nodes in a secure way. This uses **SEA** (Security, Encryption and Authorization)

**We will create a variety of screens.**  
  
1. Welcome  
2. Register  
3. Login  
4. Forgot Password.  
  
We will create our UI with [SithasoIONIC7 Wireframes](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasoionic7-wireframes-a-step-by-step-guide-to-professional-ionic-7-mobile-apps-designs.157607/) and [SithasoIONIC7](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasoionic7-ionic7-framework-powered-by-b4x-and-banano.149902/#content) for this example.
