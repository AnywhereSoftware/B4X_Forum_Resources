[B4X Forum - B4J - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/168571/)

Overview :  
  
PyPasslib is a B4J libray that enables secure password hashing and verification using the PassLib library in Python.  
It leverages PyBridge to connect your B4J app to Python, giving you access to modern hashing algorithms like bcrypt and PBKDF2-SHA256.  
  
This is ideal for developers who want to implement strong password security in their B4J apps without relying on outdated or limited native encryption methods.  
  
Requirements :  
  
 PyBridge library added to your B4J project  
 Passlib installed in your Python environment: **pip install passlib**  
 bcrypt\_4.0.1 installed in your Python environment: **pip install "bcrypt==4.0.1"**  
  
Available Methods :  
  
 HashPassword - Returns a hashed version of the password  
 VerifyPassword - Verifies if the password matches the hash  
  
Notes :  
  
 Supported algorithms: "bcrypt" and "pbkdf2"  
 Hashes are salted automatically  
  
Usage :  
valid algorithms  
1 - bcrypt  
2 - pbkdf2  
  

```B4X
Private pLib As PyPassLib  
  
' Hash  
Wait For (pLib.EncryptPassword(Password, Algo)) Complete (hashed As String)  
Log("Hashed password : " & hashed)  
  
' Verification  
Wait For (pLib.VerifyPassword(Password, hashed, Algo)) Complete (isValid As Boolean)  
Log("Valid password ? " & isValid)
```
