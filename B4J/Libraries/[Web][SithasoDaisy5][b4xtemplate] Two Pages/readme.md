Hi Fam  
  
Let's create a two pager app using a SithasoDaisy5 b4xtemplate. This uses the **SDUI5Page** component and some other components.

[Get SithasoDaisy5 Here](https://github.com/Mashiane/SithasoDaisy5). Ensure you copy the folders in the additional folders to your PC additional libraries folder.  
  
We have two pages here, one we create the structure of the page using code (for the grid) and the other one using a layout via the designer.  
  
Also note we have env.json file here to store our app environmental variables.  
The **version** works in such a way that if we update the app, automatically this will do a hard refresh of the app.  
  
Have fun!
