JsonTree is a tool that helps developers to parse and understand JSON strings.  
  
It shows the data structure in a TreeView and it also prints the code (B4J / B4A) required in order to extract the data from the string.  
  
Note that variables in the generated code are based on the JSON fields. It may produce invalid identifiers. However it should be quite simple to take the generated code and use it in your app.  
  
The compiled jar can be downloaded here: [www.b4x.com/b4j/files/JsonTree.jar](http://www.b4x.com/b4j/files/JsonTree.jar)
