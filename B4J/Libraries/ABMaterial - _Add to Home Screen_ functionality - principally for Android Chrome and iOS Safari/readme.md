**PREAMBLE**  
  
This probably doss not rank as a tutorial but then it is not a question either - so tutorial it is.  
  
The following is the result of my attempt to get my head around the Android Chrome and iOS Safari browsers "Add to Home Screen" capability - i.e. the ability to save a website's bookmark as an icon on the host smartphone's home screen.  
  
In the exercise I test what icons actually get used - with results somewhat different to what I was led to believe would happen - see [**BROWSER TESTING TO DATE**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/abmaterial-add-to-home-screen-functionality-principally-for-android-chrome-and-ios-safari.160794/post-986867)**.**  
  
The exercise basically adds the "Add to Home Screen" capability to Alain's introductory ABM template:

And uses Alain's suggestion as a starting point:
