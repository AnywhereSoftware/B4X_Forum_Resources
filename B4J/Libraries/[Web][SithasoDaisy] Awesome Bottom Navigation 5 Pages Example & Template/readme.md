Hi Fam  
  
[Demo](https://sithaso-daisy-5-page-navigation.vercel.app/)  
  
In this example, we will create a 5 page navigation application. Whilst the pages will be accessible with the drawer, one will also be able to access the pages via the bottom navigation bar.  
Each of the pages have a toolbar and a bottom navigation bar. One can navigate from one page to another easily.  
  
The bottom navigation bar is named the **SDUIMagicMenu.** We are designing this with the free [SithasoDaisy](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasodaisy-wireframes-unleash-the-force-of-ultimate-web-mobileapp-design.161039/#content) Wireframing tool.
