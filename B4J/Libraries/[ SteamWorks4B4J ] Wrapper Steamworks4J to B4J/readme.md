hello my dear friends, I am a game developer, I have some games released on steam (all developed in C++). I'm fascinated by the ease and power of B4X , so I created a [SteamWorks4J](http://code-disaster.github.io/steamworks4j/) wrapper for B4J.  
I just did some basic functions just to boot steam, the others haven't done yet due to lack of timeâ€¦ but soon I'll do them! ( whoever wants to help me, the source code will be available soon )
