PLEASE POST SOME OF THE IMAGES THAT YOU MIGHT DISCOVER IN THIS THREAD……  
  
It is a B4J kickstart [**for this Github project**](https://github.com/TomasBoda/mandelbrot-set).

Zoom in around the edges of the Mandelbrot set - you will discover some very interesting images that seems to repeat themselves. You will also at some time or another (while zooming in) come across miniature Mandelbrot sets. Eg - after numerous zooms in various places I came across ths mini Mandelbrot set and used the MAX\_ITER button the get some better definition of it
