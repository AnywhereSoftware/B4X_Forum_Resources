**UPDATE: since december 2022, chrome plugins like this have stopped working. Luckcely, the author of this plugin has created a standalone alternative you can install on your computer:  
  
Simple Web Server: <https://simplewebserver.org/>  
  
————————————————————————————————**  
For some things in BANano, e.g. cookies, you will need to run it on a server as just opening the html file in your browser from disk does not support everything.  
  
A very easy way to do so is by installing the 'Web Server For Chrome' plugin:  
  
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en>  
  
After installing it, you will find it in your chrome apps. For me, this means clicking here:

And then:

Just start the plugin and you will be presented a popup box:

Now, all you have to do is select the folder where banano.html is located and start the plugin.  
  
You can now browse to the url the plugin is giving you:
