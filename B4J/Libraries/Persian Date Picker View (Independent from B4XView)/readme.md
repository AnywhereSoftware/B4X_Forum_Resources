Hi everybody.  
This is a Persian date picker I wrote. It doesn't use B4XView and has no special requirements.  
Displaying the date picker pop-up is done with code. It works as a ResumableSub.  
  
To use it:  
1. simply add "PerPicker.bas" to your project;  
2. Provide its main function with a parent node and an (x, y);  
3. "Wait For" it till it returns the result once the date is picked.  
  
I've attached a very simple sample usage code with it. The top part of the code and some other parts are also commented. Refer to them for more details if needed.  
  
UPDATE: The calendar now shows today's date by putting a black border around it.
