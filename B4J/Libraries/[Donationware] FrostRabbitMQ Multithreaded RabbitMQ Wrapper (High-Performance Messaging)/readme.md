FrostRabbitMQ Multithreaded (High-Performance Messaging) is an advanced B4J wrapper for the [RabbitMQ Java Client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client) library.  
It enables B4X developers to easily integrate AMQP messaging into their applications using RabbitMQ.  
  
**The [original free version](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/frostrabbitmq-rabbitmq-client-wrapper.168270/) already supports connecting to a RabbitMQ broker, declaring queues/exchanges, publishing messages, and consuming messages. Now Iâ€™m releasing FrostRabbitMQ Multithreaded, which adds multi-threading support for heavy workloads. This means you can process multiple RabbitMQ messages in parallel, taking full advantage of modern multi-core CPUs.**  
  
[HEADING=2]Free vs Pro[/HEADING]  
[HEADING=3]Free Version (Open Source)[/HEADING]  

- âœ… Basic RabbitMQ wrapper
- âœ… Queues, Exchanges, Routing
- âœ… Publish & Consume

[HEADING=3]Pro Version[/HEADING]  

- ðŸš€ Multi-threaded message consumers
- ðŸš€ Handle CPU-intensive tasks without blocking
- ðŸš€ Improved performance & stability for production
- ðŸš€ Priority support + future updates

[HEADING=2]Demo Example (Heavy Workload)[/HEADING]  

```B4X
' Simulates a CPU-intensive task handled by multiple threads  
Sub HeavyWork(Message As String)  
Log("Starting heavy work for message: " & Message & " @ " & DateTime.Time(DateTime.Now))  
   
Dim count As Int = 0  
For i = 2 To 10000000  
If IsPrime(i) Then count = count + 1  
Next  
   
Log("Completed heavy work for message: " & Message & ". Prime count: " & count & " @ " & DateTime.Time(DateTime.Now))  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub IsPrime(n As Int) As Boolean  
If n <= 1 Then Return False  
For i = 2 To Sqrt(n)  
If n Mod i = 0 Then Return False  
Next  
Return True  
End Sub
```

  
  
With **FrostRabbitMQ Multithreaded**, you can run many *HeavyWork* tasks **in parallel**, each triggered by different RabbitMQ messages without blocking your main thread.
