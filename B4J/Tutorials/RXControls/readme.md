This is a wrapper for rxcontrols library from GitHub((MIT license)). here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0UgwBxBJ74&t=137s) by the author introducing RXcontrols.  
I have wrapped 4 controls from this library, 3 of which have been posted in B4J Share Your Creations.  
1. [Another audioSpectrum control](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/another-audiospectrum-control.167176/)  
2.[Translation Button](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4j-translation-button.167295/)  
3.[RXCarousel](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4j-rxcarousel.167436/)  
4.RXAvatar, this is a new wrapper for RXControls, demo is below
