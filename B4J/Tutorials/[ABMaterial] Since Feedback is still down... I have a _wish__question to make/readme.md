Hi guys…  
  
Well, this goes straight to [USER=974]@alwaysbusy[/USER] …  
  
Is it possible to still have a left aligned container in the Navigationbar WITHOUT havins any sidebar items?  
If YES, please explain how?  
If NO, then just add this to the Wishlist…  
  
BTW, When will we have a new version of ABMaterial, and when will feedback be back on?
