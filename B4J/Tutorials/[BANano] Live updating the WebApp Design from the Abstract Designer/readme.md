In BANano v5, you could already use Live Code Swapping to speed up development drastically. In the upcoming update, you will even be able to use the Abstract Designer to make Live changes to your designs and see the result immediately in your Web Browser after saving the design changes! Again, this is something almost no other tool can do without recompiling your whole project. But in BANano for B4X, we can! ?
