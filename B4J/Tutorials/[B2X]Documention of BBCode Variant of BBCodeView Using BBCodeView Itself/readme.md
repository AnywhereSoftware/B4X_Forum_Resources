The recent addition of the anchor tag in BBCodeView opens up an efficient and effective way for creating documentation that works on a desktop and devices.  
This tag allows you to scroll to any section of a (possibly lengthy) scrollable BBCodeView.  
  
BBCodeView has grown with leaps and bounds over the years. I decided to document all current features.  
As an exercise, I decided to implement the documentation in a BBCodeView, making it pleasingly self-referential.

The attached app works in B4J and B4A. If you like it as a reference you could make the B4J version as a standalone app that can be accessed while working on other projects.  
  
It may be interesting to look at the code (600 lines including the documentation text).  
There were some challenges, such as how to display B4X code, and how to show how tables are added.
