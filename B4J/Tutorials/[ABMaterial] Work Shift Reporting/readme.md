However we may wish, data may not always be correct - either through user input, program logic or device corruption.   
  
This form allows management to ensure / correct the proper paid times for each employee - as collected from an Android B4A app.  
  
Paid times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Day shifts start before noon, night shifts after.  
  
The ID's (shift start) are created on the server (via trigger's). Start and end records (triggers) update this table.   
  
Management can add a shift record (ie. device failure) to keep the system up to date (avoid manual paperwork entry).  
  
The selected range can then be exported to a XLS file, to be merged with the payroll spread sheet that is forwarded to Head Office final payroll ( yes, some still use spread sheets).  
  
Complex logic and view created in 2 daysâ€¦ A professional would have whipped this up in 0.5 days..
