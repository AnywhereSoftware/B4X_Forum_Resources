This is a simple example to make API call to Google Gemini using OkHttpUtils2 and Json libraries.  
Streaming is not implemented.  
Get API Key: <https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys>

Basic code is provided by Gemini but I added features for:  
1. reading API key from text file and  
2. save the response to a text file.
