Hi Fam  
  
With the latest update of the SDUI5Image component, one is able to view animated webp and gif files.  
  
The src attribute should be the path to the webp / gif file, gif should be true and you can also specify a gif poster file. Once the gif is clicked, it will start playing. Toggle play by clicking it,
