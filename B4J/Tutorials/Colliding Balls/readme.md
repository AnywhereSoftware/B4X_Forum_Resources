Converted [**this Github project**](https://github.com/gtiwari333/java-collision-detection-source-code) to B4J - it is like watching snooker. A bit of physics in it to detect collisions and then change speed/direction  
  
B4J sample project attached  
Also download the attached Jar and Xml (by [USER=904]@klaus[/USER]) in case you don't have it as the project uses his lib to draw some stuff. Copied it to your B4J additional library folder.  
  
*Nice to see it in actionâ€¦enjoy!*
