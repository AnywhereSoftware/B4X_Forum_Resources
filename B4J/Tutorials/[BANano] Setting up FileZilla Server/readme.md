If IIS is running on your webserver, you can install the FileZilla server and then set it up for FTP upload. After starting the FileZilla server  
  
1. Add a user and specify a password. This is the user you will use to log in to the server.

2. Set up the shared folder and permissions. This folder will be the one listed in your client to upload files to.

You can then use these with the FileZilla client to ftp your files to your server.  
  
Good luck!
