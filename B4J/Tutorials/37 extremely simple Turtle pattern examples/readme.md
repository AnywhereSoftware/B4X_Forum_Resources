Hello all,  
In the past I wanted to learn the basics about Turtle which is also great learning aid for getting kids into programming, they learn Turtle in secondary schools here in the UK (my nephew did it).  
I knew absolutely nothing about Turtle, so I decided to learn the very basics via Turtle in B4J. The attached zip file are extremely simple examples that should help developers get started in using B4J, preferably new younger developers.
