Hi there  
  
You are developing your app and want to see it running on your device instead of your machine from localhost.  
  
The easier method:  
  
1. Enable hotspot on your phone.  
2. Connect your PC to your phones hotspot.  
3. Execute cmd > ipconfig > note the IP4 IP Address  
4. Enter this IP address on your mobile device/  
  
For example, my PC app is on <http://localhost/mybvad2webapp/index.html#/>  
  
So on my mobile device, i enter xxx.xxx.xx.333/mybvad2webapp  
  
Happy BVAD3 Coding.
