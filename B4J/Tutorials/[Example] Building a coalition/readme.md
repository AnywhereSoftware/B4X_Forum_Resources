We had an elections yesterday and I saw a nice widget which can serve as a small example.  
  
There are several parties each one with a random number of chairs.  
The government is made of 61+ chairs out of a total of 120 chairs.  
  
BitmapCreatorEffects is used to create images with other colors based on the black image.  
The chairs are updated in a resumable loop. The target number and the current number are compared each time.
