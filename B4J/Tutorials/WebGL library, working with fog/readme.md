Hi all,  
  
today I will show how the WebGL library can use the fog in your scene and can be fine tuned by code or by GUI.  
This will simulate a real realistic fog. Allowed fog and exponential fog.  
This can even used to simulate unrealisting colored fog and even to simulate dark.  
  
Here a Youtube video that show it. Make sure to set the player to 1080p.

Here you can get some other demos that use fog on the threejs official site.
