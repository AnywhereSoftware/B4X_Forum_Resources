Hi Fam  
  
In this video, we learn about the grid, and how we can add rows and columns and set them to different sizes in order to place components when designing our UI.  
  
In the abstract designer, these are the SDUIRow and SDUIColumn. By just changing the sizing to fit in the various device specs, one can create any UI they want.
