Hi there  
  
In the Mashy Teaches Series we started creating forms, as a rewind to remind us how this awesome functionality works.  
  
In part 7 of this **Creating Vuetify Forms with BANanoVuetifyAD3,** we start CRUD functionality, however not using conventional methods. We use a JSON file as a back-end instead.  
  
Watch this..
