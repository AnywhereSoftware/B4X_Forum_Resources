Hi Fam

[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) is a SQLite Webserver with some powerful functionality. Whilst it provides functionality to be a database, it also has a nice UI to manage that database. You can host it locally and also run it on a VPS. It does not support shared hosting.  
  
1. Download and unzip this repo (15MB), this is what you will find.

2. Double click the run\_server\_1001.bat file, this will start a command prompt.  
  
![](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/attachments/154410)  
  
3. Leave this running. If there is an update of pocketbase, it will be updated before your app can start.  
4. sdbms is the sub-domain of our web site. We publish all our js & css and html files there. You can rename the file to be anything you want. This sub-domain is inside the **pb\_public**

5. If you don't use a sub-domain, just publish your website on the root of the pb\_public folder. Ensure you also update the bat file to point to.  
  

```B4X
start http://127.0.0.1:1001/index.html
```

  
  
6. As there is no website published on this webserver, nothing will be shown in the browser, you will see. This means there is no database collections and no website.
