Ola, #Dreams do come true  
  
[Download](https://github.com/Mashiane/BANanoZUI)  
  
The source code for this is in the **Demos\3. LiveSwapping** folder  
  
Previsouly I [explored the BANano LiveSwapping](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-exploring-liveswapping-with-bananovuematerial.119659/) feautures with [BANanoVueMaterial/Vuetify](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananovuematerial-the-first-complete-opensource-vuejs-ux-based-framework-for-banano.113789/#content). The experience was sooo good. With my new library [BANanoZUI](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananozui-creating-zoomable-user-interfaces-with-zircleui.120514/#content) (Zoomable User Interfaces), the experience is smooth and worth the ride. You should really explore this!  
  
Here we code our zoomable user interface, this is just a beginner experience. The built up for this lib is great! The library is complete (less than 10 custom views, all created with the [BANano Custom View Creator](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-creating-banano-custom-views-with-the-banano-custom-view-creator-webapp.120086/) off course) and one with their existing knowledge of BANano and B4X, can code to their desires.  
  
The [ZircleUI](https://zircleui.github.io/docs/) website comes with tons of examples and documentation, I'm also playing with them myself, we will display maps and charts also as we go along.  
  
Let's do this!
