Hi Fam  
  
DaisyUI has about 35 themes that you can apply for your app. A simple example below is the application of the theme **synthwave** to the Demo

There are 35 themes that one can choose from. In this example we have used a toggle with a value of synthwave, and when checked it activates the theme. The **theme controller** option has also been set on for the toggle button.
