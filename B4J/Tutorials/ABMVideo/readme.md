Hi All,  
  
I am getting a " **[www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com)** refused to connect. " error when trying to connect to a youtube video, my code is as follows:  
  

```B4X
    Dim myModalVideocastVideo1 As ABMVideo  
    myModalVideocastVideo1.InitializeYouTube(page,"myModalVideocastVideo1","//www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-8_15G7kBU","//www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-8_15G7kBU",True,False,True,100)
```

  
  
This is also in a modalsheet. Also I am running in compiled localhost  
  
Thanks for help in advance.
