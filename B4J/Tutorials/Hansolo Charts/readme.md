Hansolo Charts have some very nice looking charts. Download the Jars from the link below and copy the jars into your B4J additional library folder.  
A sample project is attached ( draws 8x charts). You need to study the code in the classes within the B4J project and then add inline java code and b4j code (getters / setters) to use it in a B4J project. I have just added some samples (via inline java code in B4J classes) from the 11.2 posting here:

***See Post #7 onwards to make use of the charts in a B4J project.***  
  
Some of the charts are controlled by timers - run the B4J project and see the animations
