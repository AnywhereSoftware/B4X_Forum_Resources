Hi Fam  
  
So im debuging SithasoDaisy5, so I was curious as to how the thing can build my project after debugging without me having to open the b4j IDE.  
  
I referred CodeX to this b4x post and it figured out how to do it and built my project.

My b4xlib and my demo projects are in different folders, so all I had to do was indicate to it the source of my b4xlib, it compiled it after fixing syntax errors and fixing some bugs I picked up were available across my custom components.  
  
Well, i'm impressed. This is helping with my productivity a great deal.  
  
  

```B4X
Both projects built successfully via `B4JBuilder`:  
  
- `C:\VisualStudio\BJL\SithasoDaisy5DemoCode\B4J\SithasoDaisy5DemoCode.b4j`  
  - Output: `C:\VisualStudio\BJL\SithasoDaisy5DemoCode\B4J\Objects\SithasoDaisy5DemoCode.jar`  
- `C:\b4j\workspace\SithasoDaisy5\SithasoDaisy5.b4j`  
  - Output: `C:\b4j\workspace\SithasoDaisy5\Objects\SithasoDaisy5.jar`  
  
No compile errors.
```
