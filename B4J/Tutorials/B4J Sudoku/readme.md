Just for the fun of itâ€¦.  
  
Button Create = uses class dlx\_generator to create a new puzzle  
Button New Puzzle = use a variant of 1 of the 742 puzzles embedded in the code (randomly swapping columns/rows to create more than the 742 puzzles)  
Button Solve = obviously solving the current puzzle.  
  
It uses the Dancing Links algorithm by Donald Knuth to solve the puzzles (and also to create puzzles when clicking on button Create).
