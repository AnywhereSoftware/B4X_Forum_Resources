Hello friends,   
  
This is my first but not last post in forum :D When I checked B4J\_chat.zip file in [Erel's post](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jserial-library.34762/), I see that there is an old .fxml designer file that can not be recognized by B4J 9.8. I succeed to convert 1.fxml to 1.bjl file and succeed to make communicate Hercules (a terminal program) and B4J chat program by using AsyncStreamsText module. These are not a victory for a professional but for me it is. I explained usage of com0com (virtual serial port emulator) and Hercules in [my blog](https://erolcum.blogspot.com/2022/12/null-modem-emulator-com0com-sanal-seri.html).. Blog is in Turkish but you can translate it to your language easily by using the widget on the left side.   
I also attached working B4J program.. Thanks to [USER=1]@Erel[/USER] for useful modules like AsyncStreamsText and for all..
