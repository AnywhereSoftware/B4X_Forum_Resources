Hi Fam  
  
Please find attached a pocketbase class based on the [PocketBase JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk)  
  
In your BANano project, you need to add this line in App Start  
  

```B4X
BANano.Header.AddJavascriptFile("pocketbase.umd.js")
```

  
  
You declare a variableâ€¦  
  

```B4X
Private pb As SDUIPocketBase
```

  
  
Then you initialize it  
  

```B4X
pb.Initialize(Me, "pb", "http://127.0.0.1:8090", "projects")
```

  
  
For any CRUD related actions, you need to define the schema. This tells the class the field names and what types are they. For example  
  

```B4X
pb.SchemaAddText(Array("id", "name"))
```

  
  
There are various methods to add the schema fields.
