Hi Fam  
  
With the JSONEditor in SithasoDaisy5, one is able to open, view and edit JSON files. With the new additions to SithasoDaisy5, one is also able to convert these JSON layout files back to BJL.  
  
We earlier provided a code snippet (NodeJS based) here, <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-nodejs-bjlconvertor-on-the-web-bjl-json.169767/#content>  
  
But now we have finally managed to have a non-nodejs based version working and implemented and working well.

With the JSONEditor in SithasoDaisy5, one is able to open and edit BJL JSON files and then also will be able to convert these back to BJL files. I've just finally managed to get a web based library (without nodejs) to..  
  
1. Select BJL file and convert to JSON (as above)  
2. Select JSON file and convert to BJL.

PS: This functionality has been added to the SithasoDaisy5 LowCode to ensure that the layout manual update step is automated.
