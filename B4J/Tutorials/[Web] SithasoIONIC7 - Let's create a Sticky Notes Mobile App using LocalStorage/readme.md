Hi there fam.  
  
[Demo](https://sithaso-ionic-7-sticky-notes-in-local-storage-app.vercel.app/#/)  
  
Let's wireframe and create a Sticky Notes Mobile App.  
  
1. One should be able to create and save sticky notes.  
2. The sticky notes should be color coded. We use a FAB with colors to add color coded notes.  
3. One should be able to add, update and delete a sticky note.  
4. We will store our Sticky Notes in Local Storage - (rather volatile but will do)  
5. One can list available sticky notes.

To Add a note - we use a Bottom Sheet Modal

To Delete - we use an alert.
