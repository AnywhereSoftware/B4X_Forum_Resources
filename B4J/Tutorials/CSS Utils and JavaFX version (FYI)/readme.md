When using the CSS Utils library in a new B4J project i found that there is a newer document for the Javafx CSS properties webpage.  
In the (old - 2015) thread [CSS Utils](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-css-utils.61824/) you can find a link to the CSS properties ([Javafx 1.3](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/javafx/javafx/1.3/docs/api/javafx.scene/doc-files/cssref.html)).  
The latest version of the CSS Utils library uses javafx 8. The new link is: [Javafx 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html#labeled).

The old document mentions under the heading Labeled for a label text wrap: -fx-text-wrap.  
In the new document this changed to: -fx-wrap-text  
This might be a little confusing, it certainly was for meâ€¦
