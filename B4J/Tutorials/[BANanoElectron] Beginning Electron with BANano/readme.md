**What is Electron?**  
  
Electron is a desktop application frameworks powered by Node.js. It allow developers to create cross-platform desktop apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers web designers and developers a way to take their existing skills for crafting web apps and interfaces, and apply that to building desktop apps. The framework also support shipping apps for Mac OS, Windows, and Linux from the same codebase, meaning that developers can save time and energy when creating desktop apps that all OSs can use. Electron was born when the node-webkit, currently known as NW.js could not work well with the Atom editor from Github. It was created by [Cheng Zhao.](https://github.com/electron/electron)  
  
**How is it similar to NW.js?**  
  
NW.js and Electron come from a shared history, and have some similar approaches to app features. When the node web kit was not actively developed, Cheng worked on it to create the atom-shell but later created a completely new framework for desktop development based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
  
**We have BANanoNWjs**  
  
There is a thread here about using NW.js (node-webkit) with BANano, the [BANanoNWjs](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-nw-js-wrapper.102371/#content) library. As these share the same approach to app development, we will use the basics we learned from BANanoNWjs to begin BANanoElectron.  
  
  
**Setting up the IDE**  
  
1. Obviously you will need [BANano](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-website-app-pwa-library-with-abstract-designer-support.99740/post-627764)  
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (my preference and it makes things easy)  
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
3. Install [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)  
  
  
**Non-Implemented Features (this is not implemented on this library)**  
  
1. File System Access  
2. Native Functionalities e.g. menus (whilst discussed, not functional)  
  
Some few examples..  
  
**1. Hello World**
