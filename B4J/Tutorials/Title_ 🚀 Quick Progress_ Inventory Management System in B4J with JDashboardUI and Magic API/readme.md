Hi community,  
  
  
I wanted to share a **quick progress update** I achieved in just **a couple of hours**: an **inventory management system** in **B4J**. I was inspired by these posts:  
  
  

- [Inventory with Pakai Server + ChatGPT](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/build-an-inventory-management-system-using-pakai-server-with-chatgpt.168756/#post-1034596)
- [LowCode Web Inventory App](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasodaisy5-lowcode-how-to-build-an-inventory-management-webapp-products.168766/#content)

  
I **chose JDashboardUI** for the graphical interface, and it turned out **fast and visually appealing**.  
  
  
What really made everything **super easy** was **Magic API**:  
âœ¨ I just uploaded the PHP file, filled in 4 fieldsâ€¦ and **I already had a complete API ready to connect to my MySQL database**.  
  
  
Honestly, it wasnâ€™t difficult at all, and the progress was **super quick**. Itâ€™s still just a prototype, but it works, and I wanted to share it to encourage anyone who wants to experiment with **B4J + Magic API + JDashboardUI**.
