This is the result of an interesting distraction. I came across [this example](https://victor-fx.blogspot.com/2017/08/audio-visualization-in-javafx.html) which uses a Javafx AreaChart and the MediaPlayer AudioSpectrumListener to display an audio spectrum. I thought I would try porting it to B4j. It seems to work fairly well although I am not sure I really have a use for it, but someone might,

You can set the line, fill and background colours and colours for a gradient fill if required (as above)  
  
There are no external dependencies.  
  
It is a custom view in a b4xlib, feel free to unzip it if you want to see or play with the code, and a test project.
