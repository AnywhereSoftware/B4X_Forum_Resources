Good day  
  
In the SithasoDaisy download package, you get a MySQL Crud App for a simple expense tracking app. As a showcase, there is a b4j layout named **expenseCategory**  
  
![](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/attachments/143318)  
  
  
This layout has been built to stand alone as it's injected inside a modal during the **BuildPage** page process.  
  

```B4X
'start building the page  
private Sub BuildPage  
    banano.LoadLayout(app.PageViewer, "expensecategorieslayout")  
    banano.LoadLayout(mdlExpense.FormHere, "expenseCategory")  
    'apply master data source settings  
    app.SetBackEnd(dsExpense)  
    '  
    BuildTable  
    '  
    mounted  
End Sub
```

  
  
  
We first load the expensecategorieslayout into the pageViewer, then, inside the form of the modal, we load this layout. This layout uses a grid approach as components are placed inside rows and columns. You can get a brief about this here.

A column can span 12 spaces i.e **Size,** however you can indicate the size to take for each of the devices.

In the case below, we are saying, the size across all devices, should be 6 i.e. half of the screen.

The end result of this form isâ€¦

When the app is being ran, you will explore and learn about creating this type of table. This has badged and color coded text (green & red)![](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/attachments/143322)
