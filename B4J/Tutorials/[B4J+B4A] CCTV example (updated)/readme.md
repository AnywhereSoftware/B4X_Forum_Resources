This is based on the original example

The old B4J example is using xml layout which is no longer supported.  
The old B4A example is also not supporting runtime permission.  
I have made some modification to both projects now to use B4XPages and make them work for current version of B4A and B4J.  
Some features like saving picture, camera effects and error setting camera size parameters in CamExClass are still not working and need enhancements.
