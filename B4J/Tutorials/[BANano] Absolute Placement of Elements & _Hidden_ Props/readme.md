Hi  
  
What we will do:  
  
From:

How:  
  
Take any BANano custom view, add a Log(Props) on the **DesignerCreateView** sub, magic happens, use the view in your layout and check the web console for the output.

You get to see some "hidden props" that you can use. These are for ***enabled, visible, hanchor, vanchor, height, width, left and top*** AS defined in the abstract designer. I will call these "hidden" because these are generated by BANano for you and are read from the values set when you place the view on the abstract designer.  
  
To get access to these anywhere in the code, this is what I have done.  
  
1. create a global variable called **CustProps**

2. Copy these to the global variable

3. Set some getters for the values. I did not define temporal values to store these, so I will read them directly from the copied map  
  

```B4X
Sub getB4XEnabled As Boolean  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XEnabled")  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4XVisible As Boolean  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XVisible")  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4XVAnchor As String  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XVAnchor")  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4XHAnchor As String  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XHAnchor")  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4xHeight As String  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XHeight") & "px"  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4XWidth As String  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XWidth") & "px"  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4XTop As String  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XTop") & "px"  
End Sub  
  
Sub getB4XLeft As String  
    Return CustProps.Get("B4XLeft") & "px"  
End Sub
```

  
  
Interestingly enough, if I want to store the "state" of the custom element, I can just add another sub, to convert the whole thing to json.

When used, I do a log(â€¦ToJSON) and whala!
