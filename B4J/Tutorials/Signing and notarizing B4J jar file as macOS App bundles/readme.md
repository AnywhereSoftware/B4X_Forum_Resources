Hi  
I happen to have a mac program, which I created with B4J. When I tried to distribute the program I ran into different difficulties. One was the nagging dialogues that the download package could no been verified and thus not been downloaded. With an extra effort I could prepare a read me and explain the users how to skirt the obstacle. But I got also problems because macOS does not give the downloaded apps sufficient rights if not signed and notarized. To be honest I have not yet found out how the mechanics are precisely, but I found a way how to distribute my B4J App on the mac without obstacles and with the sufficient rights to run. Should anybody else look for such a solution, here you find the description of how I did it:

If anybody has a better solution, then I happily go through it ;)

BTW: One issue I came along is the writing of files into file.DirApp. Somehow this did not work (insufficient rights? respectively no permission to write there?). I used:  

```B4X
folder = GetSystemProperty("user.home", "") & "/Documents/"
```

  
This is not elegant, but it worksâ€¦
