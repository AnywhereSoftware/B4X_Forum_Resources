Have converted [this Processing Github Project](https://gist.github.com/hellvetica42/fe1153a12db62e867f48d280f784762c) to B4J. Very interesting to watch this being drawn in real time. Just B4J default libs required.  
  
Have not used the default Processing PVector library for the project - have hard coded the Vector multiplication, subtraction, addition, dot product, magnitude, normalization, etc inside the B4J project.  
  
Enjoy!
