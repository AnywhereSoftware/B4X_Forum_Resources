Recently a WebApp built using BANano+Vuetify was created to enable one to explore Walts B4XGoodies.  
  
**The Creation** - <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-walts-b4xgoodies-explorer-using-bvad3.130096/>  
  
We then explained how one can **access this via a Mobile Device**

This thread is closing this loop about this project. We show on this video, how does one perform a search and also is able to generate an overview that one can post on a b4x thread about their code snippets, libraries, classes etc per each of the b4x products.  
  
Enjoy
