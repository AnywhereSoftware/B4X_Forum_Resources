Have compiled [**this Github project**](https://github.com/luismsp/LPOO-FEUP/tree/master) into a Jar so that it can be kick started from within B4J. Made some minor changes to the original code to that the /res folder could be embedded inside the compiled Jar (added the /res folder with 7-Zip)  
  
Sample project attached  
Jar attached - copy the Jar to your B4J additional libs folder.  
  
Enjoy! Sure you will figure out how to play it.  
  
Please let me know if it is working on your desktop/laptop.
