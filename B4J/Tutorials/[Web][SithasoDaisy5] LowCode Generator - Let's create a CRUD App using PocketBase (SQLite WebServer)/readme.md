Hi Fam  
  
By the end of this tutorial, you would have used the [SithasoDaisy5 LowCode Generator](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasodaisy5-low-code-a-source-code-generator-for-your-beautiful-banano-webapps.168619/) to create a CRUD App using PocketBase (SQLite WebServer).  
  
If you have not got yourself up to speed with the SD5 LowCode Generator tool, check [this](https://youtu.be/6-fVLzcbvi4) tutorial first.  
  
**Contacts - Create, Read, Update, Delete Contacts**

A contact can be categorized via **Categories**. Each category is color coded.

Each contact can belong to a **Province**.

**PocketBase**  
  
Using PocketBase, we will create each of the tables to store our records.

**GitHub Repo**  
  
The indicated repo contains the source code and also a running version of the app. The running version is on the PocketBase.zip file. Unzip this and double click then **run\_local\_server\_1001.bat** file. This will start a CMD file and then open two tabs on your browser, one for the back-end and one for the app. You can then play around with the App.  
To explore the source code, you will need [SithasoDaisy5](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasodaisy5-create-websites-webapps-with-the-power-of-the-abstract-designer-opensource.165095/) + [BANano](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-banano-website-app-pwa-library-with-abstract-designer-support.99740/)

**To Do:**  

1. Add Dashboard & Excel Reporting
2. Record a video tutorial to create same app. This will be a continuation of [**this tutorial**](https://youtu.be/6-fVLzcbvi4) but for PocketBase back-end.
