My first steps towards IoT.  
  
1. Download Eclipse [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/files/binary/win32/mosquitto-2.0.4-install-windows-x86.exe)  
2. There are a lot of examples in the forum about coding this, however I needed a GUI tool to first experiment with this. A variety exists but I like [MQTT.fx](http://www.jensd.de/apps/mqttfx/1.7.0/). This has an awesome GUI. Experience it for yourself.  
3. They recommend you use the 32bit versions of the downloads on 1 and 2 above.  
  
To be continued based on my experiencesâ€¦
