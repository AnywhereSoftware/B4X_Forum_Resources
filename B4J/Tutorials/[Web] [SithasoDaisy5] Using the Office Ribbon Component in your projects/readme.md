Hi Fam  
  
I've found this amazing Office Ribbon component from Syncfusionâ€¦ been exploring how to add it in an easy fashion to SithasoDaisy5. Fortunately one is able just to select the components they need and include them in their app. One needs to get a free account and license to use the components.

Step 1  
  
Add a ribbon component to your page layout.

Step 2: Add Tabs, i.e. Home, Insert, View  
  
Step 3: Add Groups to Tabs  
  
Step 4: Add Collections to Groups. The font Group has 2 collections, 1 collection has the input components and the other has button icons.  
  
Steo 5: Add items to the collections, e.g. SplitButton, Buttons, ComboBoxes, CheckBoxes etc.
