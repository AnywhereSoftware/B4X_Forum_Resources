3. Routers & Transitions  
4. Firestore Auth  
5. REST API ([Edamam Recipe Database](https://developer.edamam.com/))  
6. JSON manipulation  
7. Sign In / Sign Up  
8. Using V-IF Directive  
9. Global Storage using javascript prototype  
10. Setting Visibility depending on device break-points  
11. Notifications via Snackbars
