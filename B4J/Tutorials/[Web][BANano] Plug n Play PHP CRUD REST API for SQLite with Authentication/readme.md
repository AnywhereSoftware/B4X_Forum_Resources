Hi Fam  
  
Previously, my post below dealt with adding a CRUD REST API in a matter of minutes to any back-end.

We also looked at how we can add authentication to this REST API on this post.

Today we look at how we can use a SQLite file for the backend with authentication also. Thanks to this [Github](https://github.com/mevdschee/php-crud-api) project.  
  
I have updated the api.php file to point to the SQLite file on the assets folder and also added the needed authentication key.  
  
Let's do this.
