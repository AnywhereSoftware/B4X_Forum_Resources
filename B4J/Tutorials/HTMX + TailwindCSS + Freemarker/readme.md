Hey there!  
Attached you will find an example on how to use these technologies with our beloved B4x.  
  
Find here the Freemarker library:  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/freemarker-library.157971/>  
  
I plan on contacting the HTMX author and ask him to post this example here:  
<https://htmx.org/server-examples/>  
  
this is the github project:  
<https://github.com/enrand22/B4x_htmx>  
  
Feel free to do a PR if you want to showcase some more of any of the technologies involved.
