This Library wraps the 2Dgraphic elements of JavaFX2 which are:  
  
[Shape](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Shape.html), [Arc](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Arc.html), [Circle](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Circle.html), [CubicCurve](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/CubicCurve.html), [Ellipse](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Ellipse.html), [Line](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Line.html), [Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Path.html), [Polygon](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Polygon.html), [Polyline](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Polyline.html), [QuadCurve](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/QuadCurve.html), [Rectangle](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Rectangle.html), [SVGPath](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/SVGPath.html), and [Text](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/text/Text.html). As well as LinearGradient and RadialGradient.  
  
You can add these in code, or use the SetObject Method to work with Nodes added using Scene Builder.

Download and unzip the jGraphicLib file and copy the jar and xml file to your additional libs directory.  
  
**Depends on:** JavaObject.  
  
I created this as I wanted to use rectangle, and got a bit carried away. So I thought I'd share it.  
  
For that reason I haven't tested everything thoroughly, please let me know if there are any issues.  
  
For comprehensive documentation, refer to the [Javafx documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/scene/shape/Shape.html).  
  
Oh, and full source is also attached.  
  
**Update to V1.04**  

- Added classes required to use GLPath and minor bug fixes.
- Released as a B4xLib.

  
I will leave the old version as it's a long time since I've looked at it and there may be some small conflicts with the new library. I didn't find any, but just a nagging feeling that it could bite.  
  
Enjoy
