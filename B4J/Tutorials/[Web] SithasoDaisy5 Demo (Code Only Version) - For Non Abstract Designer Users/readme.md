Hi Fam  
  
[Experience on Vercel](https://sithaso-daisy5-demo-code.vercel.app/)  
[Download Code](https://github.com/Mashiane/SithasoDaisy5DemoCode)  
  
The first draft of the SithasoDaisy5 Demo Code Only Version is out. This demo has been built with code only and ***does not need abstract designer layouts*** to work.  
  
Why did we also consider this approach? We have recognized that some developers prefer to type code / use AI to code above and beyond using the abstract designer and we needed to make this option available.   
  
The code has been generated directly from the layouts, i.e. we look the existing layouts and just converted each component in them into b4x code, e.g. Initialize & AddComponent with properties settings in-between. We used the same code used from our [BJL/BAL/JSON](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/web-sithasobjl-json-editor-webapp.170297/) coding tool to assist with the conversion and a lot of ChatGPT Codex to get here  
  
This UI should be the same as the layout based version. You will need the [SithasoDaisy5](https://github.com/Mashiane/SithasoDaisy5) b4xlib to run the source.
