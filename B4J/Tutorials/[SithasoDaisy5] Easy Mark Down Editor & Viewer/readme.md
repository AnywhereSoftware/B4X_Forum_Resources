Hi Fam  
  
The EasyMDE allows one to have a MarkDown Editor within their app. This is based on this [GitHub](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor).  
  
One is able to create Markdown documents and save and retrieve them. The nice thing about this editor is the additional toolbar which one is able to toggle the formats and also view the generated content.
