Hi Fam  
  
It is with pleasure to announce that our first test into this journey has yielded perfect results. A many thanks to the [MakeBxL](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/makebxl-create-a-layout-file-from-text-or-from-an-sqlite-table-b4x-tool-source-included.159023/page-2#post-977093) project and the rest of the people who make this possible.  
  
The only thing I will say is that b4x is a very powerful platform, with an amazing community. Thank y'all. Erel made the functionality to convert layout files to json and back. BANano has functionality of using layout files for one to develop their apps. Walt has bridged another gap of creating layouts using json from a database, text file etc. Amazing stuff.  
  
Anyway, I have attached the results of the first test project here. You can watch the video on how this was done. It's always easy to work with layouts as they make developing your apps easier. I greatly recommend them.  
  
Viva B4x!
