Is there a way to catch this error “java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space”?  
  
When the error happens it just seems to close the app.. I don’t want the app to close just display the error to the user.  
  
NOTE: it seems that the size if file being encrypted depends on the computer and how much memory it has..
