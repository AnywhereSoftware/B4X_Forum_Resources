Researching the internet I have found two great tools that can be used for testing webapps and webhooks.  
  
The first is called ngrok. What it does is that it creates a tunel to your web app and makes it accessible from the internet through https without port forwarding. It acts as a kind of reverse vpn but for https access only. Its link is the following:

The second and also very interesting tool is beeceptor. It is a webhook receiver and post api receiver in order to check what various services will post to your webapp and create the receiving code correctly. Its link is the following:
