Hi friends,  
  
I wrote a B4J program and a comprehensive tutorial in [my blog page](https://erolcum.blogspot.com/2023/01/b4j-hzl-uygulama-gelistirme-arac.html). It shows who is online in local network by names of persons. It scans 254 ip numbers in less than one minute.. You can see the complete source code and steps to follow for beginners, including installation and deployment.. Page is in Turkish but you can easily translate it to your language by using widget on the left side. I hope you like it :)
