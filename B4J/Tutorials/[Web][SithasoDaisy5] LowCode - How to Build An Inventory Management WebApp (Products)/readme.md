Hi Fam  
  
[SithasoDaisy5 Low Code Generator](https://github.com/Mashiane/SithasoDaisy5-Low-Code)  
  
This tutorial is inspired by [USER=74499]@aeric[/USER] post here…  
  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/build-an-inventory-management-system-using-pakai-server-with-chatgpt.168756/>  
  
Please Note: The stack developed by Aeric follows a different approach to WebApp creation using jetty and other beautiful technologies developed by Aeric. SithasoDaisy5 follows a different approach. This project is based on **BANano** and **BANanoSQL** as a back-end and is just for demonstration purposes and learning…  
  
This is just demonstrating another approach to the task at hand.  
  
Have fun.

PS: I will be demonstrating a project where we have used Aeric's tools to develop a WebApp using **BANanoServer** soon.
