***\*START OF NOTICE***  
  
**As of 02 FEB 2021, this project is is no longer maintained as it has given birth to** [**BVAD3.**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananovuetifyad-vuetify-websites-webapps-with-banano-for-dummies.124548/)  
  
*This project was a joy to create, however like everything that has a start and an end, its time to move on and evolve. BVAD3 is faster, more simpler to implement and takes advantage of the Abstract Designer use.*

**UPDATE 24 October 2020: The recommended methodology to create BANanoVuetify WebApp is being discussed here:** [**MealPrep**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananovuematerial-mealprep-app.123795/#content)**. This covers most of what VueJS + Vuetify is all about in terms of the internals.  
  
Whilst you can use the designer to create your UX, you need to separate your concerns when creating the app just like its done on the MealPrep by using components and routers for the pages.   
  
DO NOT FOLLOW THE APPROACH USED IN CREATING THE BANANOVUEMATERIALDEMO** **WHEN CREATING YOUR APPS. THAT METHOD IS NO LONGER FEASIBLE.

This thread is specifically about using the **BANanoVueMaterial Designer 3.**  
  
I'm working on an eBook about using the designer. So far it is a draft, however if you are interested to check it so long, [here is it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCK_qJNT81cVeY2QiQGy0Te-_lCYaA7_/view?usp=sharing). Feedback will be welcomed and also stuff you would like to see in it.  
  
I do greatly recommend that you go through the videos posted in the first post [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananovuematerial-the-first-complete-opensource-vuejs-ux-based-framework-for-banano.113789/#content) as they will brief you about how the designer works, this also helps you as you go through the eBook.  
  
The designer helps one to **1. Mock** an app then **2. Compile** the app in B4J (after copying the generated source code) and then you can **3. Publish** your app on the interweb.  
  
Some facts about BANanoVueMaterial.  
  
[BVM](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/bananovuematerial-the-first-complete-opensource-vuejs-ux-based-framework-for-banano.113789/#content) (BANanoVueMaterial) is based on Vuetify, wrapping Vuetify for BANano. Vuetify is based on VueJS. Try and explore [VueJs](https://vuejs.org) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) from their respective sites. I will make a silly assumption that you are prepared to also do some ground work but will do my best to make this easy peasy.  
  
The Designer is meant for you to mock your app by dragging and dropping components on a stage, change the properties of that component in the property bag, this generates the needed B4X source code and also the HTML source code. The HTML source code is usable if you want to write your app via the Vue CLI, whilst the B4X code you can only use it in a B4J Project.  
  
We will gradually work from one example app here with the designer and we will create some database based webapps here.  
  
Welcome to the world of the BANanoVueMaterial Designer!!
