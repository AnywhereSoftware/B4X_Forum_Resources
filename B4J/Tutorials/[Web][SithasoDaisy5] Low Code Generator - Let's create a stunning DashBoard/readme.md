Hi Fam

Let's say your app need a dashboard with charts and some stats. We got you!  
  
In this example we have create a page with some rows and columns. We then added stats items, inforcard and toast charts, changed some settings and got a representation of what our dashboard might look like.

We also get the B4x source code to create our dashboard.

For our address book project earlier, we might want to show the number of contacts, which ones are males or females and also full name letter distribution.
