For [this](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jmqttbroker-v1-b4a-compatible-with-events.167515/#post-1026855) and [that](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jmqttbroker2-newconnection-event.162885/) reasons. I modified the library [jMQTTBroker v2](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/mqttbroker.61548/) and added raising onConnect and onDisconnect events for broker interceptor.  
  
Broker example is from Erel's [this code.](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/jmqttbroker-v1-b4a-compatible-with-events.167515/#post-1026855)  
  
Library source code is attached.
