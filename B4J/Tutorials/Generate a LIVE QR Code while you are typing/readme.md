As the title says - it will generate a LIVE QR Code while you are typing text (adding, deleting, changing, updating, editing) in the TextArea. Have seen this a number of times on websites and thought I will do something similar for B4J (should be easy to convert to B4I and B4A).  
  
It is based on [USER=1]@Erel[/USER]'s posting here ([**I have added to the original class to allow for more QR Code version**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-qrgenerator-cross-platform-qr-code-generator-amended-to-accommodate-more-qr-code-versions.116891/post-730940)):

Enjoy - I think it is quite niftyâ€¦.??
