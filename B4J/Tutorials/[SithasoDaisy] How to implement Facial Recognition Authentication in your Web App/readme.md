Hi Fam  
  
One is able to implement facial recognition authentication without having to use a password, email etc, but facial recognition.  
  
You will need <https://faceio.net/>  
  
It has an easy to follow wizard to create your app and then incorporate their REST API / JS files into your app.  
  
A SithasoDaisy example coming soon.
