Hi Fam!  
  
In our latest tutorial video, we take the next big step in streamlining report generation for B4X Web applications — **automatically generating Excel report templates** using our low-code source generator tool (now updated to v1.1.10).

[HEADING=2]🎯 Recap: What We Built Before[/HEADING]  
In the previous video, we created a ReportManager class that takes:  

- Sheet name
- Template file
- Report output name
- JSON data records

…and dynamically populates an Excel report based on mapped column definitions. This allowed us to generate beautifully formatted reports — complete with images and custom layouts — all driven by structured data.  
  
Here was that tutorial.

But manually designing and updating those Excel templates? That’s time-consuming and error-prone — especially when you need multiple variations or updates.  
  
[HEADING=2]✨ The Big Leap: Auto-Generated Excel Report Templates[/HEADING]  
The goal of this video is to **eliminate manual template creation** by leveraging metadata from your database tables.  
  
Here’s how it works:  
  

1. **Database-First Approach**:
Using our low-code tool, we define tables (like “Products”) with fields, types, and even fake data for previewing.2. **Template Generation Button**:
A new feature — *“Generate Excel Report Template”* — scans your table’s columns and auto-generates an Excel file where:

- Each field maps to a column (Name → Column A, SKU → Column B, etc.)
- Columns marked as “None” (e.g., internal IDs) are excluded.
- No formatting applied — just clean structure ready for customization.

3. **Customize Freely**:
Once generated, you can open the Excel file and dress it up — add logos, adjust colors, merge cells, insert charts — anything Excel allows. The structure is yours to mold.4. **Auto-Generated Source Code**:
The tool also generates a ready-to-use B4X code for your Application.5. **UI Integration**:
An “Export Excel Report” button will be able on your App which when linked to your code will generate an Excel Report from your data.
  
[HEADING=2]🧩 Why This Matters[/HEADING]  
This approach drastically reduces repetitive work:  
✅ Define table → ✅ Generate template → ✅ Customize design → ✅ Auto-generate export code  
No more hand-coding cell mappings or manually syncing templates with schema changes.

[HEADING=2]🔮 What’s Next?[/HEADING]  
We’re wrapping up the core CRUD + Reporting pipeline. In the next video, we’ll:  

- Generate the full Inventory app
- Test it with WebSQL or IndexedDB
- Show deployment/publishing

And yes — charting is coming too! SithasoDaisy5 has built in components to support your Charting needs.

[HEADING=2]💡 Final Thoughts[/HEADING]  
This low-code generator isn’t about replacing developers — it’s about **freeing you from boilerplate** so you can focus on complex logic, UX polish, and unique features (like real-time charts, dashboards, or integrations).  
  
Whether you’re building an inventory system, CRM, or internal tools — automating reports with customizable Excel templates is now a breeze.
