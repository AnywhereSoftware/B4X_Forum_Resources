[B4X Forum - B4J - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/158834/)

B4J Project attached. No other libs other than the default B4J libs required (can probably be easily converted to B4A and B4I as it only draws on a standard B4J canvas)  
  
The code is simple and the principle used to do this is also simple - but it creates complex and beautiful patterns. Run the project, sit back, and enjoy the beauty of *Modular Multiplication on a Circle* for a number of minutes (put on some nice classical music in the background and relax while watching the patterns being drawn)*.* Some amazing patterns (about 99 of them) being drawn in real time - the only change from one pattern to the next is an increase of the multiplier by +1.  
  
Change the code to your liking.
