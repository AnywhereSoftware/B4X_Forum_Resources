This is a supporting library for my [printer example](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/printer-example-print-text-with-the-jfx8-printer-library.143690/#post-910679) post so there are no images here.  
  
It is a simple wrapper for the two javafx classes so you can use them independently of the printer example if you wish.  
  
For a fluent API to quickly add Richtext/Textflow to a layout see Erel's class [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-textflow-similar-to-b4a-b4i-richstring.61237/).
