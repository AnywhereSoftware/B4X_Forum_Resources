Hi Fam  
  
[SithasoDaisy5 Low Code Generator](https://github.com/Mashiane/SithasoDaisy5-Low-Code)  
  
***Good News: We have updated the LowCode tool to generate fake data.***  
  
In this 3rd part of our tutorial, we are working towards fine-tuning our UI and we use fake-data generation so that we can see the following:  
  
1. How are table listing will look like for all the various tables.  
2. How Adding records per each of the tables will look like.  
3. How Editing a single record will look and work like.  
4. We have added some new control fields for some of the tables for more information.  
  
Let's take a look at each of the UI screens where fake data was usedâ€¦  
  
NB: Our next tutorial will focus on generating the app source code, building a b4x project and deploying it.  
  
Let's jouney ahead.
