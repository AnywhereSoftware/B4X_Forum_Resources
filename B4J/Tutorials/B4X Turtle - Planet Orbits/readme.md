Very very rough (and code not optimized at all)….planets in orbit around the sun:  
1. Assumed all orbits are circular  
2. Have not scaled the orbits (else I will run out of UI space)  
3. Have not scaled the sun and the planets  
4. When starting all planets will be aligned "due south"  
5. Every "tick" event of the timer moves the planets by the angle that they will move in 24 hours (based on the approx number of days for each planet to orbit 360 degrees around the sun)  
  
I have added "Pluto" as well (9th "rock" from the sun")  
  
It gives a fair idea of how the planets move around the sun relative to one another…..
