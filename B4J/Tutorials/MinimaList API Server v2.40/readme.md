Still remember [**MinimaList API Server**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/project-template-web-minimalist-api-server.160679/)?  
  
Features:  

- It is now based on **Pakai Server** framework (v4.00) with all the features like JSON and XML support
- MinimaList API Server uses MinimaListUtils instead of MiniORMUtils library
- **MinimaList** is a library for working with Maps inside a List
- **No database** is required
- but you can persist the data using **KeyValueStore** library

Note: It is a quick example and is not well tested.  
Surprisingly, it seems working very well with MinimaList library v1.07 which has not been updated for a while.  
  
**Update:**  
The original example here has been removed to avoid confusion in version number.  
It is updated as a project template as **MinimaList API Server (2.40).b4xtemplate** available from this thread:
