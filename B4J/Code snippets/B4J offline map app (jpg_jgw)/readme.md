I can not find the offline map app for B4J, therefore I make a little code for it.  
The code is not perfect but it is at least the beginning.  
Thank you "Erel", "oparra" and "emexes" for your advices here:

The code uses jgw file with coordinates EPSG:4326 WGS 84.  
You can use jpg/jgw raster map world file format.  
You can also draw points, polylines and polygons on the canvas above the raster. I do not know the canvas limitations.  
You can change w.jpg and w.jgw and use your own jpg and jgw.  
Use also your own info txt file.  
You can use mouse button for pan and mouse wheel for zoom. Max zoom is limited.
