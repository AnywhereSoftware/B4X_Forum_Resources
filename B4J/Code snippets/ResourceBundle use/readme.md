A small example of using resourceBundle in B4J.  
  
The app uses just 3 properties files to hold the language specific text. (Co-Pilot is a dab hand at converting the original English version to other languages)  
  
The app just displays the used memory as a percentage, nothing special, but will log the value in English, German and Spanish depending on the language you choose. (en,es or de)  
  
memtest.zip = consol app  
uimemtest.zip = UI app
