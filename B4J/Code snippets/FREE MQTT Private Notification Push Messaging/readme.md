[B4X Forum - B4J - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/167596/)

hi b4x's communauty ,   
this is my first thread on b4x forum , and i'm so happy to do this ,first excuse me for my poor english and i want to give this gift to all with a best thank's to EREL and all supervisor and teams who make this possible , i'm in b4x since 2 years , to learn all time every days , and i can tell that i'm just in 20% knowledge with the best ever programing lanquage . i've make a lot of b4a and b4j apps , there is somes in playstore , somes b4j get good success , and now i begin to add here best of my knowledge to others totaly for free to cross a thanks to EREL and all others .  
  
for fisrt this is a tested MQTT push notification messaging with server app ( UI or not ) and receiver in client apps ( B4a/B4j ) i've not test b4i because i dont have it , the structure is very simple to learn and applies just change what you want ( broker name / room ‚Ä¶. ) ,  
  
\* the good things in this app is to send private or global push ( send message to specific user if user for ex connect with you client app with email you can use it as txtTargetUser ) or send message to all connected users , i've test a stress and the message arrived to 31800 users same time without any problem ,   
\* second thing , i use AS\_FloatingActionMenu and AS\_Badges , the message arrive instantally and AS\_Badges show badge as number of push , if click on button or label associated show.  
  
 AS\_FloatingActionMenu with messages arrived and if click on message it turn to (alredy read massage) and badge turn to null , i've stor message arrived on list ( you can do it with filewrite or sql if you want )   
  
**1)this is server app :**

not that in client app you must add these library ( AS\_FloatingActionMenu , AS\_Badges, Jxui , JRandomaccesfiles , Jnetwork,Jmqtt)  
and in server app ( Jxui , JRandomaccesfiles , Jnetwork,Jmqtt)  
  
this is label click even ( you can do it with button or any other b4xview)

also you must add textfield or button as name in code or change it in code , i've use as badge in label named Labelpushnotif ,   
- image is from my app   
\* you can test it and any quastion i'm here ..  
\* you must subscribe to any broker service .  
\* you must create a layout as you want using name in code or change it .
