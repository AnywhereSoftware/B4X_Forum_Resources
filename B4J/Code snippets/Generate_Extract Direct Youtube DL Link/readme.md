Hi, am happy to share this project of mine.  
What it does is, it accepts normal YouTube link and gets its direct download link from this website <https://bitdownloader.com>.  
The direct download link can be played directly in media streaming application like mediaview or b4jvlc or exoplayer for Android  
  
***This projects depends on miniHtmlParser and javaObject***  
  
Sample YouTube Link:-[youtube.com/watch?v=RgGWOBrH7Q](http://youtube.com/watch?v=RgGWOBrH7Q)  
Generated Youtube link:-<https://r2---sn-a5meknzl.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?expire=1599274508&ei=q6lSX-T5OYejir4PmZmNyAE>………………..
