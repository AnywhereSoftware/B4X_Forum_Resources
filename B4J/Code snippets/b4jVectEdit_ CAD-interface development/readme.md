Hi, All  
  
It's my idea to create the interface of CAD software template version that can  

- create the vector objects
- drag objects over the work area
- move the area
- click the objects, pins
- zooming the objects by the mouse wheel: by re-calculation of each object

It's just my first try to create the vector object editor, and i decided to stop development cross-platformerly (also for B4A)
