[B4X Forum - B4J - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/112652/)

**SubName**: cHolidays  
  
**Description**:  
  
I came across some excel formula's (<https://www.tek-tips.com/faqs.cfm?fid=7549>) for determining when a holiday was and on what day / date.  
Thought it was an interesting way of doing it so I converted the code to something I could use in B4A and B4J  
  
Some of cHolidays that you can check for are not real holidays "Black Friday" for one.
