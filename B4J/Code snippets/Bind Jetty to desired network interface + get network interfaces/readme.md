Hi,  
  
Is there any way to make Jetty to use only WIFI interface or only ethernet interface?  
  
Example: if I disconnect ethernet, and start Jetty, it will take IP from WiFi, but if I start it when both interfaces are up and connected it will use ethernet as default.  
  
So, how can I give him the instructions which interface he should use.  
  
Thanks!
