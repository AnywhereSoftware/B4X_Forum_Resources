### [PyBridge] Visualization of hierarchical data with Plotly by Erel

Plotly is a very rich and powerful Python library for the generation of interactive charts: <https://plotly.com/graphing-libraries/>  
The output of Plotly, in this case, is a html string that is loaded to a WebView.  
  
As a first example of Plotly I'm demonstrating how to visualize hierarchical data:

The (outdated) data source: [plain]<https://gist.github.com/tiagodealmeida/0b97ccf117252d742dddf098bc6cc58a>[/plain]  
  
Dependencies:  

```B4X
pip install plotly  
pip install "plotly[express]"  
pip install pandas
```

  
The data is loaded into a 2d table - a list of lists:  

```B4X
Dim Data As List = B4XCollections.CreateList(Null)  
    For Each c As Map In RawData  
        Dim Country As String = c.Get("countryName")  
        Dim Population As Long = c.Get("population")  
        Dim Continent As String = c.Get("continentName")  
        Data.Add(Array(Continent, Country, Population))  
    Next
```

  
It is then converted to Python Dataframe and the html is generated by the provided code.  
  
The Path parameter specified the hierarchical order. As we don't have a single root node in the data it is added with the Constant method:  

```B4X
Dim Path As List = Array(px.Run("Constant").Arg("World"), "Continent", "Country")
```
