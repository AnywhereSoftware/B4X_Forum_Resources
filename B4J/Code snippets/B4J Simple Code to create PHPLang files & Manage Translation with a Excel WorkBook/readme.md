Sometimes it is very hard to have to maintain a translation of a website PHP.  
Erel has long published an impressive tool: B4XLocalizator that greatly facilitates the work of translation within the app with a Excel workbook.  
  
Well, I have made this simple code to help generate the files that allow us to maintain a website translated in several languages.
