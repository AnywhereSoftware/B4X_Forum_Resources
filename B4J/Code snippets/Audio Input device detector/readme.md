Hi,  
  
I have been searching for the last 3 days for a quick code to get a list of Audio Input devices (Microphones) on the system  
and display it in a Combo-box.  
  
Finally, have managed to put together a small example to do this, **using In-line Java**.  
  
Uploading the application source code, as a ZIP file.   
(Hope it helps someone like me, who is not very good at Java) ;)  
  
Cheers! ?
