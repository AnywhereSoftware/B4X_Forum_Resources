 [Now for some code snippets...  
  
**Removing Attributes**  
  
One of the elusive attributes is the 'disabled' attributes for elements. Apparently whether you set this to true/false **to enable** your element, the status quo stays the same. It seems the only way to toggle this is to remove it to enable your element.  
  
The code snippet here is to remove attributes from elements.  
  

```B4X
'remove an attribute  
Sub removeAttr(elID As String, attrName As String)  
    elID = elID.tolowercase  
    Dim jQ As BANanoObject  
    jQ.Initialize("$")  
    jQ.Selector($"#${elID}"$).RunMethod("removeAttr", Array(attrName))  
End Sub
```

  
  
#Tested  
  
**Update: 30 Jan 2019**  
  
A new method to remove attribute has been added as BANano.BANanoElement.RemoveAttr](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/banano-create-your-ux-with-materializacss-using-uoebanano.101856)
