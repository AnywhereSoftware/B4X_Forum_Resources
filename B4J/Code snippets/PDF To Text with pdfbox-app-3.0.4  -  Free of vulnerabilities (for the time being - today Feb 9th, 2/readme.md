I have found different examples in the forum using previous versions of pdfbox-app. When I tried to locate the needed libraries in the maven repository I found out that there is a lot of vulnerabilities in the previous versions so I checked and discovered that for the time being only the two most recent versions are free of vulnerabilities. I took the most recent version which is 3.0.4 and created the code. You will need to download version 3.0.4 from the following link and add it to your additional libraries. The project is atouched.
