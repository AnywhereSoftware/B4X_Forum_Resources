A simple example of how to obtain (hear) commands from controls such as Xbox and others.  
  
The example is simple, it gets the button, trigger and analogue commands.  
  
I made the example based on my Xbox controller connected via Bluetooth.  
  
There are other functions available if you want to add them.
