1 line code snippet to add Additional Jar for SQLite.  
Come handy for me as every time I can't remember the file name.  
  
Just put the "SQLite Additional Jar.txt" into B4J Additional library folder. Refresh Libraries Manager tab in the IDE.

To use, start typing "sql" or code.  
Take note, you need to type the keyword [after Sub Process\_Globals](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-code-snippets.152450/#post-1029721).
