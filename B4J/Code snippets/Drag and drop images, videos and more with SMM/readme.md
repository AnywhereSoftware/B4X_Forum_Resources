Inspired by: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/drag-and-drop-file-into-a-b4xfloattextfield.170224/> and <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/drag-and-drop-file-into-a-b4xfloattextfield.170224/>, and based on the powerful SMM framework: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-simplemediamanager-smm-framework-for-images-videos-and-more.134716/#content>  
It will show any type that is supported by SMM. Note that not all types are enabled by default. See SMM thread for more information.  
It also takes care of jpeg orientations, supports gifs, webp and more.
