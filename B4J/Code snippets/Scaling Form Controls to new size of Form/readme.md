Well,  
  
sometimes questions get answers –> sometimes creating simple and crazy ideas… but here we are…  
  
Well this question:  
**<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-zoom-form-pane-b4xview.136107/#post-861197>**  
made me think how to resizecontrols/scale them to a bigger or smaller form (perhaps for touch screen/tablet windows apps)..  
  
I thought creating this Sub **SizeControls**(t As Form, width1 As Double, height1 As Double, width2 As Double, height2 As Double)  
  
Need some more edits… hope all you guys help me to create something for all needs  
  
- **Need to** Getting and Setting Size of Font for every Node  
- **Need to** Extract inside Nodes into Nodes (like old Pane) (i have a pane in example attached that having into buttons) / pane resizing but buttons not…  
  
Have a try - Run and resize form… i got the XUI Views Example Erel created and put it into there to test it…

*ps: You need to set Horizontal and Vertical Anchor (for your projects) left and top… to work better…*
