Hi Fam  
  
First thanks to [USER=1]@Erel[/USER] for providing the [core libraries on Github](https://github.com/AnywhereSoftware/B4J) and secondly for this [JsonLayouts tool](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-jsonlayouts-synchronize-json-and-binary-layouts.167398/)   
  
This tool has been inspired by these tools.  
  
Here we go.
