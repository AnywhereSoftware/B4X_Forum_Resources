### Python B4XSerializator by jtare

If you ever need to send B4X objects from Python service to a B4X app/service or vice versa, this might be helpful. By using the opensource code of B4J and B4A on GitHub, along with some assistance from ChatGPT o1 model, I created a Python class to make it possible.  
  
Yes, you should be using JSON or keep concerns separated, B4X objects for B4X clients or python with existing industry standards. But since it is possible, why not, at least for testing ideas.  
  
Short example:  

```B4X
from B4XSerializator import B4XSerializator  
serializer = B4XSerializator()  
my_dict = {â€¦}  
bytes_data = serializer.convert_object_to_bytes(my_dict)
```

  
  
  
Full example:  
[SPOILER="Full example"]  
The following is a Flask server that serves a B4X map at the /test endpoint, along with a B4J client that requests this object by calling the API.  

```B4X
from flask import Flask, Response  
from B4XSerializator import B4XSerializator  
  
app = Flask(__name__)  
  
  
@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])  
def test_b4x_serializator():  
    serializer = B4XSerializator()  
    my_dict = {  
        "key1": "value1",  
        "key2": False,  
        "testKey": 123,  
        "nestedList": [1, 2, 3],  
        "nestedDict": {"innerKey": "innerValue"},  
        "byteData": b'\x00\x01\x02',  
        "floatVal": 3.14,  
        "longInt": 1234567890123456789,  
        "shortInt": 12345,  
        "byteInt": -128,  
        "nullValue": None  
    }  
    bytes_data = serializer.convert_object_to_bytes(my_dict)  
  
    # Return the bytes as a response  
    return Response(bytes_data, content_type='application/octet-stream')  
  
  
if __name__ == '__main__':  
    app.run(debug=True)
```

  
  

```B4X
Sub AppStart (Args() As String)  
    Log("Hello world!!!")  
    Dim j As HttpJob  
    j.Initialize("", Me)  
    j.Download("http://localhost:5000/test")  
    StartMessageLoop  
End Sub  
  
Sub JobDone(j As HttpJob)  
    Log("Job succes: "&j.Success)  
    Dim ret As Map  
    ret.Initialize  
    If j.Success Then  
        Try  
            Dim ser As B4XSerializator  
            Dim respMap As Map = ser.ConvertBytesToObject(Bit.InputStreamToBytes(j.GetInputStream))  
            Log(respMap)  
  
            For Each k As String In respMap.Keys  
                If respMap.Get(k) = Null Then  
                    Log(k & ": is null")  
                Else  
                    Log(k & ": " & GetType(respMap.Get(k)))  
                End If  
                
            Next  
            
        Catch  
            Log(LastException)  
        End Try  
    End If  
    StopMessageLoop  
End Sub
```
