### Tab stop order on B4X forms by BierHops

I learned something this morning and thought I'd share a snippet with my kindred noobs:  
I'm new to GUI writing, in fact until a couple of days of this post, all my programs have been console programs.   
  
If you're wondering how to order the tab stops on your window, the View Tree on the left most pane (Main -> Button1, Button2, etc.) is also the order of stops on the window. So, if you're like me, and you don't plan well (or you don't do GUI programs often) you can drag your items up and down on the list and change where they are in the stop order.  
  
Hope this helps.
