[B4X Forum - B4J - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/124999/)

This program is an extension of a simpler one I did for B4a and uses some of the features I have also seen on other programs.   
  
It can plot 3 Y variables against the X axis. The Y axis range for each is determined from the data and the intervals of the graph divisions set to sensible whole numbers for each plot according to the individual plot data  
  
I have limited the max data value to 50,000 but this can easily be extended  
  
The objective of this program is to have X and Y axes that are meaningful with whole number intervals for any data input  
 As there are multiple plots on one graph the number of Y graph divisions has to be the same.  
  
Each graph can be selected or deselected and there is a cursor with values attached.  
  
As this was written for B4j it is necessary to delete the whole graph page and reformat if a plot is selected or deselected. This would be much easier in B4a as you can draw a transparent line over a plot to delete it.  
  
The plots are from 0 to the maximum data value  
  
I have yet to come up with an algorithm that gives sensible interval values between min and max values. Next coronovirus lockdown maybeâ€¦ Any suggestions on how to do this or comments to this program gratefully accepted
