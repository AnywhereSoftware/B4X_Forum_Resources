For who has cPanel hosting: If you have a backup of cPanel mail folder, you will find all emails in raw files, each email account has a raw files, you can't read them easily as outlook.  
This attached little b4j app will read that mail folder as outlook (organized, well formatted, readable).  
  
Thanks
