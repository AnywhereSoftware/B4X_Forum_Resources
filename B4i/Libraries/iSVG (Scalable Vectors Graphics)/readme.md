This library is based on SVGKit open source project: <https://github.com/SVGKit/SVGKit>  
It allows displaying SVG graphics.  
  
There are two steps:  
1. Initialize the SVG object with the SVG file.  
2. Export the SVG to a Bitmap based on the target size.  
  
Repeat step #2 whenever the ImageView size changes.  
  
See the attached example project.
