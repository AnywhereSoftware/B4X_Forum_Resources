Good evening everybody!  
  
Who needs to use WKWebView without the Designer, he can use the following library.  
  
In this way you can use WKWebView as if it were UIWebView. Plus you can set the browser opacity and background color.  
  
Moreover, in addition to the UIWebView there is the event that is called in the execution of the javascript (JSComplete)  
  
Shortname to use in your code is WKWebView2  
  
I hope I have done something pleasant.  
  
The zip file contains the xml file to be copied to the b4i installation and the .h and .a files to be put in the MACBuilder.
