Hi,  
  
I hereby make my updated library available to all.  
In the example all necessary functions are included.  
  
I send the library files for the host builder to Erel, so that the host builder can compile the programs.  
The file "fsPreferences.xml" must be saved under "C:\Program Files\Anywhere Software\B4i\Extern-Library" or similar.  
  
You can make each entry dependent on another entry, and it doesn't matter if it is the first or the last entry.  
  
You can find the version for B4a [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/fspreferences-preferencemenu-preferencemanager.144397/).  
  
Since the library is larger than 512kb, I have split the zip file into 2 files.  
To decompress the zip files the extension ".txt" must be deleted.  
  
"fsPreferencesB4i\_v3.00.zip.001.txt" -> "fsPreferencesB4i\_v3.00.zip.001"  
"fsPreferencesB4i\_v3.00.zip.002.txt" -> "fsPreferencesB4i\_v3.00.zip.002"  
  
For questions or help, please write here.  
  
Ciao,  
Filippo
