[B4X Forum - B4i - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/130745/)

Hello, this is a library that is still in beta.  
  
I have no expectations. (Except for likes :) ) If you want, you can take the codes with winrar and open B4Xlib codes, edit and duplicate them. Because sharing is good.
