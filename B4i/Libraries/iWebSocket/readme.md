A WebSocket client implementation. This library is based on this open source project:  
<https://github.com/square/SocketRocket>  
  
The API is the same as B4A WebSocket library. The WebSocketHandler class which is used to connect to B4J WebSocket servers is included in the example.  
See this link for more information: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/websocket-client-library.40221/#content>  
  
  
Edit: the library is already included in the IDE.
