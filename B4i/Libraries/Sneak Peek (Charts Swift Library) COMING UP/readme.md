Hi all, i'm really excited and couldn't wait, so I decided to give you guys a sneak peek at what i'm working on, This is officially my firsts B4I Library, it is based on [this project](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts) I decided to give it a try since i've never really written a B4I Library specially in Swift, the framework is Swift based but of course the wrapper is written in Objective C, thanks to everyone who has helped me by answering my stupid questions in the Forum so I can continue working on this library.  
  
Attached is a picture of what the outcome looks so far, I still have some minor tweeks to work on and once i'm happy with what it looks like I will release it, hopefully you guys find it useful.
