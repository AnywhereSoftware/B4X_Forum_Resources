iAmir\_ChartView another wrapped ios library ;) ( <https://github.com/Hypercubesoft/HCLineChartView> )  
  
With this library, you can fully customise how your line chart looks. Itâ€™s easy to setup and use in any iOS project. It supports chart settings directly from interface builder with live preview. Automatic redrawing on orientation change will make it easy for an application that has portrait and landscape layout.
