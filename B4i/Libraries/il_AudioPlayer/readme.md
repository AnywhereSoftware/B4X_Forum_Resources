***il\_AudioPlayer - View***  
  
I would like to share with you CustonView i have created for my new B4i App. It is an AudioPlayer with a nice UI and lot of functions  
like playing Songs in background, Playlist, FileDialog and much more. It is still in the testing phase but i think it is already ready for use in real applications.  
The player is also very customizable since you have all layouts and icons included and you can enter them and edit them if you  
like (dont remove any views or add new views just edit colors if you want).  
  
  
**Installation instructions:**  
  
- Copy the \*.a and \*.h files into the folder "Libs" in your MAC or in your MAC HOSTED by AnywhereSoftware, normally in "B4i-MacServer\Libs" folder  
  
- Copy the il\_AudioPlayer.xml to your custom libraries folder in B4i  
  
- Unzip Files.zip and copy all files to your ../Files Folder (it includes icons, layouts, etcâ€¦). The Example.zip includes already all necessary files.  
  
- Select lib in Libraries Manager
