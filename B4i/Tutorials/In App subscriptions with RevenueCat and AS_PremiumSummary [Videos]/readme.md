[B4X Forum - B4i - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/165841/)

In this tutorial I will show you how to create subscriptions in the Apple Developer console, how to link them with revenuecat, how to integrate the [B4X-RevenueCat SDK](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/revenuecat.162348/) in the app and how to present the whole thing to the customer in the app with [AS\_Settings](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-settings.147435/) and [AS\_PremiumSubscription](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-as-premiumsummary-payware.160614/). The B4X-RevenueCat SDK uses the [iStore](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/istore-in-app-purchases.49301/) library. The RevenueCatPurchaseHelper takes a lot of work off the developer's hands.  
  
In app subscriptions is a big topic and overwhelms you at the beginning, to save me and others a lot of time and work I have written libraries to minimize errors during implementation and get to the goal faster.  
  
Overview of topics:  

- Creating subscriptions in the Apple Developer Dashboard
- Linking subscriptions with Revenuecat
- Integrate B4X-RevenueCat SDK into the app
- Settings page with premium button
- Design of the subscription page with feature listing and prices
- Purchase processing and activation of premium features
- Check whether the user has an active subscription
