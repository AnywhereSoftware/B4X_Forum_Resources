Starting from B4i v7.20 it is possible to install apps, when the iOS device is physically connected to a local Mac, using Apple Configurator 2.  
It is supported by all iOS versions and is a must with iOS 14.5+ when using the local builder.  
  
Benefits:  
  
- No need to approve installation.  
- Simpler process.  
  
Enabling this feature is done under Tools - Build Server - Server Settings.  
  
On the Mac:  
  
- Open the app store.  
- Install and run Apple Configurator 2  
- Select Install Automation Tools in the top left menu.  
  
**Note that with a local builder, this is now the only way to install apps.**
