hi, B4X is definitely the best platform to generate applications, but every time I go to work with push notification I panic because I can't get the way to create development and production certificates in a simple way.  
At the end of so much struggle, I manage to create the certificates, but I spend hours. Will someone have a summarized step-by-step manual?  
  
Thank
