Hello B4X'ers,  
This tutorial is to show developers new to the B4X suite of development tools just how quick and simple it can be to create a simple game using B4i (original code was created using B4A).  
  
I've tried to make the code as simple as possible for all new B4X developers to follow as I've added comments throughout the whole code.  
  
**Note:** The downloaded source code includes both B4i and B4A projects. Ignore the initial missing files warnings, just run the project and the files **WILL** be copied over.
