This can be useful when you encounter hard crashes. I usually use it when encountering hard crashes with new libraries. Requires a local Mac.  
Alternative method: [Tip: on device logs](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/156056/#content)   
  
1. Set the device ip to Simulator.  
2. Run the app in release mode (Alt + T + B + R)  
The simulator will open and the app will be installed on the simulator.  
  
3. On the Mac, go to the UploadedProjects folder and open B4iProject.xcodeproj.

Now you can run the app and debug it.
