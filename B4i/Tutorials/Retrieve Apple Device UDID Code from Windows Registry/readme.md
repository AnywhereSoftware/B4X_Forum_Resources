When you connect an Apple device to a Windows PC with the USB port, Windows creates a Registry Key with the device's UDID and can then be retrieved.  
But to avoid reading the entire log, I created a small app that retrieves all the UDIDs present in the system registry.  
   
Steps:  
1. Plug Apple device into USB port  
2. Unlock the device and have it recognized by Windows  
3. After recognition, disconnect it  
4. Download ([**from here**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/retrieve-the-apple-device-udid-from-windows.132824/)) and start the B4J App and … *et voilà*
