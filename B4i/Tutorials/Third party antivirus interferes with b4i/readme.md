Perhaps this is well known, if so sorry. My third party anti-virus software may have been interfering with B4i (worked fine on android!). I use AVAST and had to create an exception for B4i. After I did that compiling was easier and the need to "clean project" went away, as well as the inability for the computer to connect. Both hosted server and local benefitted, and I am saving a lot of time.
