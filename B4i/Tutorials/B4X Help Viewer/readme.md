Attached you find a B4x Help Viewer.  
The [original program](http://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-xml-file-help-viewer.6764/#content) was written by Andrew Graham (agraham) for B4A with Basic4PPC desktop.  
Andrew is no more active in the forum and some time ago I asked him if I could get the source code to adapt it if needed.  
I have been using this program since the beginning and find it very useful, simple and efficient.  
As the basic help files in B4i are xml files like for B4A, I adapted the souce code to dislpay either B4A, B4i, B4J and B4R xml files.  
All the credits go to Andrew Graham, I have his agreement to publish it here.  
  
Unzip the file, it's an \*.exe file, there are four libraries included.  
  
The program is explained in the [B4X Help Tools chapter 2.8 *B4x Help Viewer*](https://www.b4x.com/guides/B4XHelpTools/?page=18).  
  
EDIT 2024.03.16 Version 3.4  
Changed the default folder names for the libraries.  
From C:\Program Files (x86)\Anywhere Software  
To C:\Program Files\Anywhere Software.  
If you are already using it, there is no need to update, the change was made for new users when the program is run the first time.  
  
EDIT 2021.09.07 Version 3.3  
New user interface.

EDIT 2019.01.30 Version 3.1  
Added B4X support.  
For xml files for B4X Libraries.  
When you compile a module into a library, an xxx.jar and an xxx.xml file are created.  
When you create a B4X Library the xml help file is not automatically generated.  
Erel has written an application to create [xml files for B4X Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/tool-b4xlib-xml-generation.101450/).  
Don't copy these files into the product specific Additional Libraries folders.  
Create a specific subfolder for them in the Additional Libraries folder.  
  
EDIT 2016.04.13 Version 3.0  
Added B4R support  
  
EDIT 2015.04.18 Version 2.9  
Amended the problem reported [HERE](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dateutils-simplifies-date-and-time-calcuations.26290/page-5#post-330658)
