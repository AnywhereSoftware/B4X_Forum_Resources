Tag property holds an object and allows to keep many parameters (for example, as Map). But to use separate fields is more comfortable.  
  
An attached sample (based on stackoverflow's ideas) shows how to add properties **myProperty1, myProperty2** to any view. Main part - OBJC code.  
If to have a wish, it's possible to describe additional properties in iCore.xml.
