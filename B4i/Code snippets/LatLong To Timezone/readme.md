Hi,  
I was looking for a code to know the timezone information from Latitude and Longitude coordinates and I found the code here [LatLongToTimezone](https://github.com/drtimcooper/LatLongToTimezone) but it is written in other languages so I converted it to b4i class, try it in release mode as when you run the project in debug mode it shows an error I think it's because of the long of the class code, the project file attached.
