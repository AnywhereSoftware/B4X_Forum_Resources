Hi everyone, i want to share this "chat layout".   
I hope it will be useful to somebody.  
It is a translated version from the [Andoid one](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/responsive-chat-example.110959/#post-699526) by [USER=49674]@Douglas Farias[/USER].  
  
It has some bugs, that someone can help me to fix.   
For example i want the CustomListView always display the last element (without bringing all the view all way down, and without strange graphical glitches)
