When I look a photo in a smartphone, enough often appears a wish to increase a image/text like in WebView.  
  
So I did special custom view based on ScrollView.  
Works in two regimes.  
1) As zoomable Panel (if is set ContentView property)  
2) As zoomable ImageView (if is set ContentImage property)  
  
If you notice any problem, pls, let me know.
