Hi everyone, i want to share with you this example project, that is a slightly modified version of [this one](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/paging-indicator-for-scrollview.66094/#post-697788).  
Maybe can be useful to someone else.  
  
It's adapted to be an horizontal panel scroller, that correctly center the loaded layout in the panels.
