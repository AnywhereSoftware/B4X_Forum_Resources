Unfortunately Android provides no direct way to determine whether the soft keyboard is shown or not so the IME.HeightChanged event uses a bit of a hack. to detect this. The problem that I have found is that, particularly when rotating a device with the keyboard is open, different soft keyboards and different devices produce different erroneous layouts after rotation, particularly in split mode.

Useful to integrate FFMpeg into your app without having to use jShell. The library jars are quite large, so if you only want to use it for the odd conversion it might be better to use the Shell option. With the library, users of your app won't have to install FFMpeg on their machines.  \n  \nThere are 2 b4xlibs attached and a test project for each (you will have to change at least the source and target filenames to use the test projects). if you want to get real-time messages (progress information) you need to use the Threaded version of the library.  \n  \nThere are some examples on the [jave2 github page](https:\/\/github.com\/a-schild\/jave2), but not many.
