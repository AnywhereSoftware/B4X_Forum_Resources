I placed it here as I use it with a B4A appâ€¦  
  
Sometimes you need a QR-code generator in your website (which is working together with B4x). I searched for a standalone creator which is easy to handle. I came to this site: [QR-code generator](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious). I uses Javascript to generate the QR-code. I've modified the example (removed all inputfields and replaced them with simple variables).   
  
I needed the display of a QR code on my website to secure the login and other things (code is scanned in a B4A app). Just double-click on "createqrcode.html". Edit this file to see how a code is generated (very easy to integrate it in your website)). This example runs without a running webserver.
