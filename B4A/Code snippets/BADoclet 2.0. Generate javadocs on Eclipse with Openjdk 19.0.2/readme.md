Hi all,  
  
after I had this [problem](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/solved-cannot-generate-library-javadocs-on-eclipse-with-openjdk-19-0-2.167032/), [USER=52836]@Daestrum[/USER] courtesely tried to create a new custom BADoclet capable to generate javadocs on openjdk 19.  
This worked well for me on Eclipse right away, from the first time I tried it , so a very magic handâ€¦. ðŸ¤© ðŸ¤© ðŸ¤©  
  
After that I asked permission to release the doclet on this forum for peoples that need it in future.  
  
Always courtesely I received the permission to do it, so I will post that here now.  
  
All credits, and many thanks to [USER=52836]@Daestrum[/USER]  
  
Enjoy
