hello here is a code that reads Wgs84 coordinates DDmmss.ssss / DDmm.mmm / and DD.ddddd and converts to floating point coordinates, its good for importing from csv files and does irregardless what character symbol is in them, as long as the digits follow the proper sequence , just paste the \*txt code into an empty project and test in debug mode to see what it actually does ,  
hope it helps
