[B4X Forum - B4A - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/167835/)

I wanted to share a simple code snippet that shows how to create a UI settings menu using B4XPages, XCustomListView, and basic row templates. It's fully customizable and supports both light and dark themes. Feel free to adapt it to your needsâ€”this is just a starting point to inspire your own implementation.  
  
The code posted is only for B4a but can easily be transferred to b4i or b4j
