This sample its based on the thread <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/background-location-tracking.99873/> of [USER=1]@Erel[/USER].  
  
1) In an Activity, I start GPS and get Latitude & Longitude  
2) then, pass this values to GeoAddress2,  
3) and then obtain, Address.  
  
It runs perfecto on a HAUWEI P10.  
  
I recommend that test it first in your device and look if it can help you what are you intend to develop.  
  
This sample gives you an idea how GPS Library works!.
