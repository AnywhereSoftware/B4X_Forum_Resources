Want to say Sorry for posting some bad code yesterday.  
  
I had ChatGPT help me with writing the renewing of tokens and it has such a bad habit of trying to set header values before calling job.download or job.poststring  
  
Not even going to mention that it took all my define strings and hard-coded in the function.  
  
ANY way, Upload a new version. ALL Functions have been tested and I included a complete test program (minus your dropbox info)  
  
Be well. Hope this works for everyone.  
  
Again sorry for yesterdays code. Will try not to let that happen again.
