Greetings to all, I want to publish this to help others who, like me, are newbies to b4a, since a few days ago I was having the need to select text in a LABEL with justified text that I use within a CLV to show certain large strings and I could not find something that will help me to do it until I found this example of erel to customize the context menu, using java code, and it has been my basis for the solution to this need, I must clarify that I hardly know anything about java programming, but I managed to do these modifications and adapt it to be able to select the text of my LABEL in the CLV items and later color those portions of text, I hope it is understood and it helps others as well as it served greatly for me and please, if there are errors, let them know in public So that we all learn more, I am not an expert but maybe one day I will be ?, greetings.
