To convert my apps was pretty easy. I just opened my activities(B4A) and code modules(B4i & B4J) with notepad ++ then I changed their types to class. Then I Changed all my show methods(B4i & B4J) and Activity\_Create(B4A) to B4xPage\_Created then for dynamic data populations I moved all those methods to B4XPage\_Appear. That was all . B4A especially become easier with Pages.
