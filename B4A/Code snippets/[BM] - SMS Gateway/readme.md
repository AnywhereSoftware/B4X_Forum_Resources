I'm working on a new project that involves sending SMS messages to my clients.  
  
While doing some research, I found online solutions that involved paying a fee per message.  
  
So, I wanted to create an alternative that was cheaper and more manageable.  
  
To do this, I created this little app that creates a REST API within our phone and allows us to send SMS messages to any number we want through our personal numbers.  
  
I hope this help somebody.
