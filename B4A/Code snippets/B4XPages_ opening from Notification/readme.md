[B4X Forum - B4A - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/167341/)

This my code is an example of the app template combining:  

1. B4XPages 2-page app for targetSdkVersion="34"
2. Autostart Receiver
3. Foreground service with notifications (for example, of FOREGROUND\_SERVICE\_MEDIA\_PLAYBACK type, check the Manifest editor)
4. Where notification of each page allows going to another page
