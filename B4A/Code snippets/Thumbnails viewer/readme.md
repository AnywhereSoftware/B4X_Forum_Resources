A HorizontalScrollView with square panels to hold the thumbnails of the images.

With automatic scroll behavior so that each selected item can be seen in its entirety on the screen.  
  
With a colored frame for the selected item. Frame position memorized.  
  
I think it takes less memory to overlay a marker panel, transparent with a colored border than to paint a border over it with Canvas.  
  
With the option to remove each panel with its image.
