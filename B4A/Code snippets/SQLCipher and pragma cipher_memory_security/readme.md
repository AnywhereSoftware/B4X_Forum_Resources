SQLCipher has this pragma that can speed up SQL quite a bit if memory security is turned off. Been using this for a few years now  
in a large database and never seen a problem with it. It can be useful when running multiple SQL's or running a single slow SQL.  
Attached a simple demo project that hopefully demonstrates all this well.
