I'm sure that many of us have had the desire to use an old smartphone as a PC keyboard.   
In this link find a source that does this using the SD\_CustomKeyboard(B4X) and jawtRobot (B4J) library  
The same code for Android would work for iOS.  
  
You can also do the opposite using Accessibility on Androidâ€¦ but this will perhaps be a post for the future
