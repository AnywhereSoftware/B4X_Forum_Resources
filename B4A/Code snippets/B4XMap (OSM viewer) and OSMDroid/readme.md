Have converted my map code from OSMDroid to B4XMap, that currently is I have both options in my app.  
As far as I can see there isn't anything that can't be done with B4XMap that can be done by OSMDroid, that is  
for things I need. So, I am thinking to take all the OSMDroid code out and rely on just B4XMap.  
Is there anybody who has done similar and come to the same conclusion or are there reasons to stick with OSMDroid?
