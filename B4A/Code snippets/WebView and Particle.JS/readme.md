Hi All,  
  
Ever wondering my B4A app has nice looking background with animation, to be honest - i know nothing about live wallpaper nor how to create bitmap animation using canvas.  
  
I ever saw in the net, a page using nice animation called [Particle.JS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/). It's javascript code to generate the wonderful animation.  
  
So i made simple login page which use WebView as animation background.
