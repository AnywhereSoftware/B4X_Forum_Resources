Hi All,  
  
Here with Attached simple project to demonstrate how to call B4A Sub in WebView using WebViewExtra (v1.42).  
  
I'm not play often with this lib, but found some interest on how B4A can interact with WebView via Javascript.  
  
The project will:  
- Load html from asset  
- Call Javascript function inside html file from B4A  
- The Javascript will call B4A sub and display as a response  
  
I hope it would be useful for everyone who interest.
