Hello,  
I put the example below with the thought that it may be useful to someone.  
  
We are talking about the case of a system use type: **ToastMessageShow ("Message", False)**  
  
Usually, each repeated tap on the button that causes a message - causes the message to be displayed each time,  
This example will change it. Well, by clicking the button without a break, only a single message will be displayed.  
  
Yes, you can come across a library with a similar action in the collection of the forum.  
I will gladly know your other ways to get the same effect.  
Regards.
