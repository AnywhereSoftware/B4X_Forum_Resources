Is there a way to fetch an image from a link, for example, <http://example.com/jpg>, and once it is fully downloaded, upload it to another server, such as <http://example2.com/upload.php>, and have this process repeat from the beginning once it is completed?  
I have performed the download using the following link, but I am unsure about the upload process.

Thanks as ever
