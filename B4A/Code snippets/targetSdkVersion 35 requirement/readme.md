The behavior changes are listed here: <https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/behavior-changes-15>  
  
The only issue that most developers will encounter is related to the new "edge to edge" layout. I recommend disabling this feature for now: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/targetsdkversion-35-and-opting-out-of-edge-to-edge-enforcement.167109/#content>  
  
During July I will release an updated SDK package with SDK 35, though you can already install it now as explained in that link.  
  
Note that the IDE currently shows a warning if targetSdkVersion isn't 34. You can ignore it. It will be fixed in the next update.
