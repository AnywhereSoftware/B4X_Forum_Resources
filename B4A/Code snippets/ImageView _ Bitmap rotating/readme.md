[B4X Forum - B4A - Code snippets](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/133078/)

As a continued work from this post: [Peel routine](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/acceptable-anyone-have-an-image-peel-routine.131362/#post-831314)  
  
The code post in the above link had 4 changes all based on center or x or center of y turning.  
  
I've added 8 more (4 that are like a door hinge and 4 that are a spinning image)  
  
Turned the routine that does this into a class so it should be easy to use.  
  
When I have time will add more.  
  
Updated - 1005 Added some more images and added names for different routines.  
 Press and HOLD Random button will do a routine show (cycle 100 times)  
  
Updated - 1010 Sorry couldn't help myself added - 8 Swings (swing from top / bottom / left / right)  
 Also changed Random button to just be a press to Randomly show 100 times  
  
Enjoy
