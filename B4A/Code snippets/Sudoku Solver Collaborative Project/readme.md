This may not be the place to post this but hopefully someone will put it where it needs to be  
  
I created this as a 'lazy' Sudoku solver and it developed a bit by adding in brute force auto-solving.  
I have included a medium and a hard Sudoku puzzle as a test. The auto-solve will do the medium but not the hard.  
  
I was interested to see if any other members of this forum are interested in contributing other solving algorithms for a bit of fun. I have no desire to publish this, its just an exercise.  
   
This started of as a simple program so I have not structured it as I should as it grew. But you will get the idea.  
  
The instructions are in 'information'   
It has been written for a 10" tablet
