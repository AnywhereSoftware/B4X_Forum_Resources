I wasn't quite sure where to post this information, but this is actually the best place to put it…  
  
Anyone who deals with navigation is probably familiar with the WMM. The WMM can be used to compensate for the location-dependent deviation of a magnetic compass (magnetic anomalies, long-term changes in the earth's magnetic field), so that the needle really points to north… The model is valid for the next 5 years, the current model WMM2020 will be replaced by the new model WMM2025 at the end of the year.  
  
The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is the standard model for navigation, altitude, and heading referencing systems that use the geomagnetic field. The WMM is also used for civilian applications, including navigation and heading systems.  
A new version of the model is updated every five years to address changes in Earth’s magnetic field. The current version (WMM2025) was released on December 17, 2024, and will remain valid until late 2029.  
The model is produced by the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United Kingdom’s Defence Geographic Centre (DGC). NCEI and the British Geological Survey (BGS) jointly developed the WMM.  
  
You can find the new original COF file [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model).  
  
For Android applications, I recommend [this in-depth thread](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/magnetics-library.16661/#content). **DEREZ** wrote this wonderful piece of software that makes the COF file (in modified syntax) usable.  
  
Edit:  
Attached is the modified COF file for use with the class made by Derez.
