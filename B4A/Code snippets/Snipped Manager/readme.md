Dear friends,  
I looked to the snipped managers as pointed out in this forum and I am not convinced. Searching the Internet I found several better solutions. The one I choose is a **portable windows desktop application. It is working fine on my win 10 64-bit system.**  
  
We all know that b4A is not a programming language that is common therefore I had to **adopt the software** a little bit and now you are able **to manage snippeds for B4A.**  
If anyone likes to manage also snippeds for B4J aso. please tell me an I will include this to.  
  
The best is that the **application is free of charge** so you may download it from snippedmanager.org (updates).  
  
Please find **attached the last version adopted by me.** Unzip the Files into a directory and start the exe - thats all. The application has a fine help but is self explanationed. To give you some benefits in addition I filled up the snipped database with some snippeds I found here in the snipped forum. I will move on to do this and from time to time I will publish updates with more snippeds If it is requestd by the forum.  
  
Stay well and good luck with this helping hand.:)
