Hello all!  
I would like to share the following source code with everyone (*without image files*).  
A lot of time spent, so it's probably worth someone to use it for your projects. :)  
  
The following code to use allows you to build a file explorer.  
An example is attached.  
  
What distinguishes this from other explorers is that the upper beam (**‚Üê back**)  
it is not controlled as the other elements of the list (it always remains in place),  
always available and in view.  
  
The example uses the following libraries:  
Core (version: 4.92)  
RandomAccessFile (version: 2.30)  
Reflection (version 2.40)  
  
and class module: ClsSlidingSidebar (Excelent job! Author: **[Informatix](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/members/informatix.22203)**)  
  
Best regards.
