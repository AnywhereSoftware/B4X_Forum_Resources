Hello All  
Here we have a simple example of how you use corwin42s [**WatchFace Library**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/watchface-library.74228/). The WatchFace library is extremely simple to use, corwin42 has done a great job wrapping it, thank you.  
  
In this example we not only show the battery level, time and date using a custom font, but we also load JSON data from the internet to display information.  
  
I'm not sure how long the JSON feed will stay up, it maybe only months or several years. So I've decided to download the 2 current JSON feed files and attached them to this post for future reference, just to be on the safe side.  
  
**Edit:**  
Removed LEDCoronavirus.zip - Original file (2 downstairs)  
LEDCoronavirus\_V1.0.0.1.zip - Optimised and removed unnecessary code, tidied up the Manifest.
