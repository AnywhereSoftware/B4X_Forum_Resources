Good evening to all.  
Maybe this is an old question but i've searched all over the forum and i haven'found an answer.  
Sorry if this question is duplicatedâ€¦  
I'd like to have a horizontal scrolling list view with different image for each item.  
I've tried to modify the example without appreciable results.  
I'm not able to add Images.  
Clvx.add doesn't allow me to add image  
Some suggestion?  
Attached the simple test i've done.  
Thanks in advance.
