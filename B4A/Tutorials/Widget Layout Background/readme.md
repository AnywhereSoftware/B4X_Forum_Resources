I'm just trying to add a background image to the 4x1 widget from the following excellent thread:  
  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/widget-layout-resizable-adaptive.115638/#post-989760>  
  
But the Labels does not shown, can somebody illustrate the issue ?  
  
I just made the following:  
1. Add Imageview to the panel on 4x1.bal file.  
2. Add ImageView to the manifest: CreateResource(layout, widget\_4x1\_layout.xml, â€¦  
3. Add style to set alpha and scaleType, saved to res/values/style.xml (read-only)  
  
See the attached example.  
  
Thanks in advance ?
