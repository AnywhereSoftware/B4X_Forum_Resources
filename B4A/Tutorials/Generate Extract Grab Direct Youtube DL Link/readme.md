Hi, am happy to share this project of mine.  
What it does is, it accepts normal YouTube link and gets its direct download link from this website [https://bitdownloader.com](https://bitdownloader.com/).  
The direct download link can be played directly in media streaming application like mediaview or b4jvlc or exoplayer for Android  
  
***This projects depends on miniHtmlParser and javaObject***  
  
Sample YouTube Link:-[youtube.com/watch?v=RgGWOBrH7Q](http://youtube.com/watch?v=RgGWOBrH7Q)
