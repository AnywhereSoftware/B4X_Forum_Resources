This is an example of updating app to newer version.  
In real usage, the new apk should be downloaded from a server to File.DirInternal.  
  
Note:  
In this example, the apk file (version 1.01) which is compiled in project 2.zip is attached inside the assets folder of (version 1.00) of project 1.zip to simulate the situation.  
The file 2.apk has some code commented and libraries removed to reduce file size for uploading to the forum.
