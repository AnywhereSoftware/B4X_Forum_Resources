Hi,  
  
Had made an application in B4A (my first in B4A) to display COVID-19 statistics.  
Lots of data is specific to India. You can change them to reflect data from your country.  
  
Used quite a bit of code samples from this forum. Thank you all. ?  
  
Posting it here, hoping it helps someone.
