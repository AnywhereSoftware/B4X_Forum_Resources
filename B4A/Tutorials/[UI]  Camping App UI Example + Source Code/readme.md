Hello Community!  
This is the first UI Example by XTools Group and more examples are on the way :)  
In this example we've used CustomListView & XUI Views Librarys and implement a self-made Bottom Navigation(Not the best way).  
And don't forget to check out the Designer Visuals along with the code!
