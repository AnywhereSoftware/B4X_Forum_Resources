\*\* This is the only option to enable location services from inside your app. \*\*  
  
Example was updated and is based on B4XPages.  
Don't miss:  
  
1. ShowResolutionDialog sub that is added to Main. It needs to be added to the activity that hosts B4XPages.  
2. #AdditionalJars in Main.  
3. Manifest editor addition.
