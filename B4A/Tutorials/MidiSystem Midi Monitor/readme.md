This example is deprecated, see [Midi Monitor2](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/midi-monitor2.167812/)  
  
This is the last example for now, it provides a midi monitor for messages based on the midi channel that the messages are played on.   
  
It uses Informatix's wonderful accelerated surface to take the strain off the gui for displaying the monitor, available here: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/lib-accelerated-surface.27462/>
