Hello B4X'ers,  
This morning as my new clients are currently beta testing software that I developed for them using B4J ?, I thought to myself lets create a quick and simple game using B4A for the influx of new B4X developers that will be happening in the near future :cool:  
  
I decided to modify and use the flip cards code that I previously posted to help me create this game, this is to show developers new to the B4X suite of development tools just how quick and simple it can be to create a simple game using B4A. Whilst using my previously posted code to create this game, I realised that there were a couple of issues with that code. I've now resolved those issues and re-uploaded the flip cards code file for all to use.  
  
So taking into consideration that this morning I had to resolve issues with the flip cards code, resolving those issues and using that code to create this extremely simple game took me about 2 hours in total to complete. I've tried to make the code as simple as possible for all new B4X developers to follow as I've added comments throughout the whole code.  
  
**Note:** The downloaded source code includes both B4A and B4i projects. Ignore the initial missing files warnings, just run the project and the files **WILL** be copied over.
