Hi Friends,  
  
As you know, I made an online sheet of Walt's B4XGoodies List and he helped me by providing download links of html and version text files.  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4xgoodies_from_walt61-online.110060/>  
  
Since being lazy by nature, I find it extra work to check the version link daily and download the html file to update the sheet.  
  
So, I did what I do best. I made a HMG app (single exe, no framework or dll required) with two buttons to "Check Version" and "Download HTML" files. Most may wonder why I did not make in B4J, well I am still novice in it and it will take few days for me to make than the HMG one which I did in few minutes. I also added a parameter in it and scheduled the exe to auto run daily and show me message "Same version" or "New version".  
  
Below are the few images from the HMG app,

But the Android programmer in me was not happy. And I thought, this is my best chance to make a simple, still very useful app for myself. This will also give me the required push to make the app.  
  
I made the Android version of the same (thanks to Klaus's booklet, Philip's ebook and Forum message gold mine) in few days. It is still very primitive compare to the creations uploaded here by members.  
  
I request Masters here to suggest/advise me to make it better. I know friends here can make the whole app in few minutes and that too much more professional one. But I want to learn and want the guidance and not the whole app.  
  
Below are few images from it,

I hope this will also help beginners here to get the concept for similar app, i.e. download a link, check and show data.  
  
I have attached the project here and will update it as and when I enhance it with support from our friends.  
  
**Known Issue:  
Future Plan:**  

1. Widget to show message "Same version" or "New version" on home screen, auto.
2. Saving the html data in Sql database.
3. Using the database to show

- B4A : n numbers libraries
- B4I : n numbers libraries
- etc.

4. Using the database to show in XCLV instead of Webview.
