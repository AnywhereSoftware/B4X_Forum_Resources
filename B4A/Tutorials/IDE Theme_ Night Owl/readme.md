Even though I don't know enough to help people with B4A code, I thought that I would give back what I can and share an IDE theme with you.  
  
I ported one of my favourite VS Code themes, [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) to B4x and it's attached to this post.  
  
It's a quick-and-dirty initial conversion, and still does need a few tweaks and refinements, but most of the elements are the right colour.  
It's good enough to start using, so I thought that I would upload it here - hope that it's useful to someone.

(For the curious, the font used in the screenshot above is [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).)  
  
I'll update it further when I get a moment.
