Two apps show methods and their usage to recognize chess figures and their position based on a camera shot, one using only OpenCV image processing and utils (Chessboard OCV) and the second one using Tensorflow Lite (Chessboard AI) to classify the figures. A standard FEN string is then created for further processing by chess engines like Droidfish. Please refer to the description attached for more info.
