Hello Community!  
This is the third UI Example by XTools Group and more examples are on the way :)  
You can find our UI Examples Here :  
[HEADING=2][[UI] [B4A] Camping App UI Example + Source Code](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/ui-b4a-camping-app-ui-example-source-code.133449/)[/HEADING]

In this example we've used CustomListView & XUI Views Librarys. And the Bottom Navigation is coded "Simply" and added to better display the "appearance" of the app.  
But we are working on some B4X Libraries, so for now , just get Inspirited about the Design and not the code :D
