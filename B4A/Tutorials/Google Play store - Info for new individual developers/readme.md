You are probably aware that the play store has new requirements for new individual developers to publish an app.  
  
Having been through the grinder to get my simple app published, I wanted to share some information to anyone who might be trying to get an app published for the first time.  
  
After several weeks of frustration with technical support tickets I decided to ask my nephew for some assistance. He has nothing to do with the play store but is pretty high up in Google management. He agreed with me that the requirements were pretty arduous. Based on his feedback I think you will have better luck with a new app by using these guidelines.  

- Aim for 20+ testers
- They must be opted in for 14 consecutive days
- It's best if each tester is active for each of the 14 consecutive days. E.g. open the app, click through 3 screens, close it
- It's even better if each tester submits feedback multiple times over this period, even if it's just to say "looks great"
- It's also better if you release an update once or twice during this period, even if it's just a minor tweak, as the testers updating gets logged as activity
- When you make the submission, be superfluous in describing the testing

If I had known the above, I believe I would not have had to repeat the two weeks of testing 3 times. I hope this information is helpful.
