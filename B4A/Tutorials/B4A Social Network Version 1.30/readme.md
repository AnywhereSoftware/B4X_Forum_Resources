Like any work that takes me quite a long time to complete and in addition that I am a finalist at the university, I had to give up my bachelor's thesis a little to update this application, so I think that it deserves a donation. For anyone interested, please contact me on my email address: [email]sergenova135@gmail.com[/email]  
  
It's part of the development of our B4X community, so the source code is not for sale but just deserves a small donation. Sorry for my English, I don't speak it well enough.
