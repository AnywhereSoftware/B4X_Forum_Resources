The attached project includes a slightly modified version of HttpUtils2 and a new service named DownloadService. The purpose of DownloadService is to make it simple to download files of any size.

It is very simple to use this service.  
  
Start a download:  

```B4X
Sub btnDownload_Click  
   Dim dd As DownloadData  
   dd.url = link1 '<â€” download link  
   dd.EventName = "dd"  
   dd.Target = Me  
   CallSubDelayed2(DownloadService, "StartDownload", dd)  
End Sub
```

  
  
Handle the events:  

```B4X
Sub dd_Progress(Progress As Long, Total As Long)  
   ProgressBar1.Progress = Progress / Total * 100  
   Label1.Text = NumberFormat(Progress / 1024, 0, 0) & "KB / " & _  
      NumberFormat(Total / 1024, 0, 0) & "KB"  
End Sub  
  
Sub dd_Complete(Job As HttpJob)  
   Log("Job completed: " & Job.Success)  
   Job.Release  
End Sub
```

  
  
Cancel a download:  

```B4X
Sub btnCancel_Click  
   CallSubDelayed2(DownloadService, "CancelDownload", link1)  
End Sub
```

  
  
DownloadService allows you to download multiple files at once and track the progress of each one of them.  
  
The following libraries are required:  
OkHttp  
StringUtils  
Phone (required in order to acquire a partial lock during the download)  
RandomAccessFile  
  
As this is a modified version of OkHttpUtils2 you should not reference OkHttpUtils2 library. You should instead add the three modules from the attached project. Note that the modified code is in Sub hc\_ResponseSuccess.
