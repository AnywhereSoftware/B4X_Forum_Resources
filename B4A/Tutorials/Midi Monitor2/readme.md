This is a rewrite of the original [midi monitor](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/midisystem-midi-monitor.50111/#content) example as a CustomView in a B4xPages project. It eliminates the need for threading and the AcceleratedSurface libraries.

It also implements loading midi files using the Content Chooser.  
  
Requires a configured [MidiSystem](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/midisystem.50106/#content) library (See instructions on that page).
