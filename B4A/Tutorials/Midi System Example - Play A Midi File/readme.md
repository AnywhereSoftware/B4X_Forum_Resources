This is the simplest of the examples and just loads and plays a midi file. It requires the Midi System Lib available here: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/midisystem.50106/> and all it's dependencies.  
  
Also requires Dialogs library from [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dialogs-library.6776/)
