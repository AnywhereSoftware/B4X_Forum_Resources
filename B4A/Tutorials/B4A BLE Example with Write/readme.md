I have created an app to read and write to BLE devices. This is an extension of BLE\_Examples.  
  
In this example the scan lists all devices found. You connect to a device by selecting it in the list. At this time it connects to the device.   
  
Hitting the Read button gets the characteristics from the device. From the characteristics list you select the characteristic you want to write to. Then put your data in the dialog box to send it.  
  
Dependencies: you will need to download the Dialogs library  
  
This may not be the best code as this is my first VB project in over a decade. So, I'm sure I have used some c#/Java/Python semantics. Let me know if there is anything I can do to make this project better.
