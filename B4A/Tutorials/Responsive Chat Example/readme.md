This example use xCLV and IME lib (Already in B4A).  
The messages fit both vertically and horizontally, making them fully responsive.  
  
Note: The text field expands according to the text size.  
Note2: When you are typing text the sound icon changes to the send icon, as in whatsapp.  
  
You can download it hereâ€¦.
