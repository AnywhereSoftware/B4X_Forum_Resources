Hi all.  
I've been looking at my old sources and found this example, and now I'm going to share it with you.  
  
this example size is 14mb+ because have 200+ audios example.  
The example use CLV with 2 columns, is very simple.  
  
it is on portuguese but very easy to translate (database)  
  
PS: on example you can play audios with play button, stop with stop button.  
this app is based on this  
(<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.catbag.sonswhatsapp&hl=en_US>)  
  
PS2: It is old source, is not totaly bug free, test it.
