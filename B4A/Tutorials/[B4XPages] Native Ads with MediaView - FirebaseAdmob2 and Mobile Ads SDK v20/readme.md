[B4X Forum - B4A - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/131211/)

This is an update to [this code](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/native-ads-unified-with-mediaview.100350/) to use the native ads with the new lib FirebaseAdmob2 and new Mobile SDK (20).  
Thanks to [USER=1]@Erel[/USER] for the help in the [related](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/solved-b4xpages-how-to-call-a-sub-in-main-from-a-third-b4xpage.131075/) [threads](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/solved-native-ads-with-mediaview-firebaseadmob2-and-mobile-ads-sdk-v20.131006/) in Android Questions.  
  
Whenever possible, create an Native Ad to diplays video, because it has a better revenue than an ad with only image.

To use it in a non b4xpages app, check the old code and made a few changes.  
Feel free to make any changes that you want and share with us.  
Will be nice too if someone port the code to use with the [AdsHelper class](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/adshelper-extends-firebaseadmob2-google-mobile-ads-v20-0.129696/).
