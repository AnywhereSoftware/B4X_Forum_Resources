I know it is simple info for experts, but it is critical point for who want to start using B4XPages projects:- B4XPages project is for cross-platform development, that is mean when created; all templates of B4A,B4i & B4j are created, **BUT** the main entry module for all is one, it is **B4XMainPage** module, so when you coding inside it, this will affect all three apps B4A+B4i+B4j.  
So don't forget this info: **B4XMainPage**  is single file used by all B4a+B4i+B4j projects.
