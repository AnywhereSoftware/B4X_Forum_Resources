For some time now, it has not been possible to place short links to contacts on the home screen via the Contact Apps. Instead, the selected contact is always placed as a widget. However, since I like to create folders with contacts, this solution using widgets does not work for me.  
  
Therefore, I have extended the old ContactsUtils example by Eril (<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-contactsutils-provides-read-write-access-to-the-stored-contacts.30824/#content>) so that a long click on a contact places a shortcut to the contact on the home screen. Additionally, I have also added an input field for filtering the contact list.
