There are some examples on this forum for  
1. saving Webview content as Bitmap,  
2. creating PDF file using [Printing](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/printing-and-pdf-creation.76712/) library and  
3. opening or sharing the PDF file to WhatsApp using [FileProvider](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-fileprovider-share-files.97865/) library  
  
but I don't see combination of these code  
so I have made a lot of trials and errors and  
finally come out with a working example.
