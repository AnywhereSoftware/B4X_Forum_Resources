This is very clever software and when I first saw it, it blew my mind. It took a couple of seconds for me to comprehend what I was seeing.  
  
The program is called **ScrCpy** and when run on your Windows PC, it will open up a window that shows you what is on your Android device. You can then use your keyboard and mouse to make it appear you are running your Android app on your PC (wrap your head around that for a minute). That's like the tail wagging the dog.  
  
You don't need physical access to your Android device any more because is is now controlled from the PC. What appears on the Android device will appear on your PC. The software is actually capturing the screen from the phone and running it in a Window on your PC, but you can control the phone from your PC. That means you can use your mouse to scroll the Android app, click on buttons and enter in text. You can go back to use the screen on your Android device at any time and the window on your PC updates too. Switch back and forth as much as you like because the two are tied together.  
  
You could hide your phone behind your PC (still connected via USB debugging) and fake people out by making phone calls with your desktop app. Loads of fun. Give it a try, it's free and open source.
