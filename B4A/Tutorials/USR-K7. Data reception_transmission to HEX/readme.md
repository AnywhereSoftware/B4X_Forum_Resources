Hi everyone!   
I'm starting to study B4A. Faced a problem. I ask for your help.   
I have a device (Super Port USR-K7). In VB.net, I implemented sending and receiving data to HEX). Now I try to do this on the Android platform.  
How do I connect to a device via TCP (or UDP), transfer 4 bytes and get a response to HEX too? Maybe there is some example? K7 is connected to the router, to the local network.
