Most of us know the material icons / fontawesome.  
  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-materialicons-web-font-chooser.103985/#content>  
  
That link is some what outdated. So made a new easy guide.  
  
1. Download the latest version of Material Icons(6000+ Icons) from "[materialdesignicons.com](https://materialdesignicons.com/)"  
2. unpack on local computer  
3 Copy "materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf" to your %App%/Files folder.(u can also rename the file)  
4 Add it To files and change typeface to "materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf"  
5 Open in the unpacked files "preview.html" in a webbrowser  
6 Click on the icon u want and it will automatic copy to clipboard and then just paste it in the TEXT Field.  
7 Done  
  
Have fun
