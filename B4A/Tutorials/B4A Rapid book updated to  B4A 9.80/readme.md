I am happy to announce that the both the paperback and electronic versions of the B4A tutorial and reference book “B4A Rapid Android App Development using BASIC” by Wyken Seagrave have now been updated to cover version 9.80 of B4A. It includes documentation of all the core B4X libraries.  
  
The paperback is available from the Penny Press website at <https://www.pennypress.co.uk/store-2/> and from all good bookshops. The ISBN is 9781512296259.  
If you buy directly from Penny Press you will also receive a free electronic book, free shipping and free updates of future editions of the ebook.  
  
**Support for Erel**  
  
Now that B4A is free, in order to support Erel and Anywhere Software continue to develop this amazing product, Penny Press will give them 10% of the profit from the sale of this edition of the book.  
  
In addition, to help the long-suffering people of Palestine, 1.5 million of whom have little or no access to water and sanitation, and many more who do not have enough food or medical supplies and rely on humanitarian help to survive, Penny Press will donate an additional 10% to Palestine relief agencies.
