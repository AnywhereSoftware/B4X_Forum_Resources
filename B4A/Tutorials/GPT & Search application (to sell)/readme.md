**SALE OFFER**  
  
I offer two types of sales including:  
- Sale of the copy of the project: I will keep the project and the right to publish the application.  
- Sale of the entire project: I deliver the project and I will no longer have any rights to the project.  
  
For every two sales I offer a sales contract.
