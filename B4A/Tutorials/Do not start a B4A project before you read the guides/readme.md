After reading so many threads from new 'member' s , I feel that we have to make humble request to all new members :  
  
**Do not start a B4A project before you read the guides.**  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/documentation.html>  
  
**Pray ! At least read the first 4 (four) guides.  
![](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/attachments/99445)**  
The one/two hours you will give to it, will save you hours on Android development with B4X.  
  
Android OS follows different rules which many of the members coming from another languages falter. If you have done some java then you will find many things similar. But if you are coming from another language you will make mistakes which are obvious in another language.  
  
**So, please invest some time in guides and you will reap rich fruits thereafter. Good Luck.**  
  
Regards,
