An example of sending data from device A and display on device B screen using UDP protocol.  
This is one of the solutions to [this thread](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dual-monitors.149673/page-2#post-949398).  
The code is kept since Aug 2023 but I don't see any one bother to ask how to implement it.  
Today I share it but I hope people have really tried on their own, not waiting to get spoon feed.  
  
There is another example using [MQTT](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dual-screen-using-mqtt.167508/) which I have already shared on previous post.
