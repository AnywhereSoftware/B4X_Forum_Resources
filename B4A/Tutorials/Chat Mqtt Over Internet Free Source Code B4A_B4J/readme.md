Hi to all  
Based on this link <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-cross-platform-chat-layout-example.112649/#content>  
I have added MQTT.  
It's a simple example that I want to share with you  
Have fun improving it, perhaps adding a base64 security on the string etc.  
Note: if you change the topic name, remember to split the string  

```B4X
GetIDFromTopic = Topic.SubString(10)'get UserId
```

  
otherwise the way of writing on the chat is wrong.  
The attached examples are client.  
You can install it on multiple devices.Each app has a different id.
