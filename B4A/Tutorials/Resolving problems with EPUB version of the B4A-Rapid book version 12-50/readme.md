Two people have complained that the EPUB version of the B4A-Rapid book version 12-50 is corrupt.  
We have not been able to reproduce any errors.  
We can read the EPUB on a Windows 11 PC using calibre and Aquile readers.  
We can also read it on an Android tablet using Moon Reader and Evie.  
  
We have had some suggestions about how to fix the problem but we cannot test their suggestions without being able to reproduce the problem.  
We would be grateful for any suggestions about what we should do.
