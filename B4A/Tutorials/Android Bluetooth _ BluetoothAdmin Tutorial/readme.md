**Better implementation based on B4XPages:** <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4xpages-bluetooth-chat-example.119014/#content>  
  
Tutorial was rewritten in April 2018.  
We will create a chat example between two Android devices.  
  
All the non-UI code is implemented in a class named BluetoothManager. It is initialized in Service\_Create of the starter service.  
  
It is always better to implement communication related code in a service or a class initialized from a service. This way the communication state is not affected by the activities more complicated state.  
  
The activities call the class methods directly. Calling the activities subs is done with CallSub. Remember that CallSub doesn't do anything if the activity is paused.  
  
The first activity, the main activity, shows two buttons. One for searching other devices and one for listening for connections.  
  
Searching other devices requires a "dangerous" permissions (see the runtime permissions tutorial for more information).  
Note that you need to add the permission in the manifest editor:   

```B4X
AddPermission(android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
```

  
  

```B4X
Sub btnSearchForDevices_Click  
   rp.CheckAndRequest(rp.PERMISSION_ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)  
   Wait For Activity_PermissionResult (Permission As String, Result As Boolean)  
   If Result = False Then  
       ToastMessageShow("No permissionâ€¦", False)  
       Return  
   End If  
   Starter.Manager.SearchForDevices  
End Sub
```

  
  
The second button sends an intent to the OS to make the device discoverable and then calls Serial.Listen.  
  
Once a connection is established:  
1. AsyncStreams is initialized in prefix mode (see the AsyncStreams tutorial for more information).  
2. The ChatActivity is started.

**Notes**  
  
- In this example we send text messages. Use B4XSerializator to send more complex types.
