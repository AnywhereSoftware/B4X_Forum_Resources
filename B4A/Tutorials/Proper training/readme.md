[B4X Forum - B4A - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/157152/)

As a beginner can someone please refer me to a good tutorial to use B4A. I have found nothing and the tutorials on this forum was clearly done by someone  
with very little teaching skills (if that was by the creator - sorry that a lot of your hard work is lost by poor tutorials/training). Without naming them the voicesless tutorials   
where trainers are happily clicking away at the sound of music is not helping at all. Why bother? I have looked on Udemy but it only seems to be a cource in Italian? Any help would be much appreciated. Regards
