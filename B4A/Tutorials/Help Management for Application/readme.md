Hello hope your'e well.  
Apps are getting more and more complicate and to work with the user needs a manual. This examples shows how you can add an help dialog to your B4XPages Project. The help information is taken from a pdf file. The help index is created from the app. If you do not like to show the help as a dialog it should be easy to modify the code to show it on a B4XPage or Activity.  
  
**Features:**  
- show individual pdf file (manual)  
- goto first, next, previous, last pdf page  
- goto entered page number  
- create and show Page Index  
- goto page number selected by index  
- move and zoom pdf page with gestures
