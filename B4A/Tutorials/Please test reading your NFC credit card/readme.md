Please test scanning of your NFC enabled credit card using the APK in the [**download link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yvXUF59eLuE57jpzASCTNM_BvqbyTbaq/view?usp=sharing) below. Please ensure that you have enabled NFC on your cell/device before you do a scan - the project will not at this time check if you have NFC enabled on your device. There is no internet connection required so it will not reveal any information to anyone other than to yourself. The Label at the top of the UI has some of the important information of your card. The EditText at the bottom of the UI has the detail of the comms between the device and the card and is scrollable. Hopefully you should see something like this:

It might be a bit "painful" as once you requested the download I will get a Google email to enable you to download the APK.  
  
Would be interesting to see if it can scan some "worldwide" cards. Will appreciate it if you could let me know.  
  
Have not built any error checking into it at present - so, for some cards it might crashâ€¦.but it was tested with about 6 cards from various locations in the world.
