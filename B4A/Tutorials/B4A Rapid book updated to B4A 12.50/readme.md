I am happy to announce that both the paperback, PDF and EPUB versions of the B4A tutorial and reference book “B4A Rapid Android App Development using BASIC” by Wyken Seagrave have now been updated to cover version 12.50 of B4A. It includes documentation of all the latest core B4X libraries.

It is also available on Amazon and from all good bookshops but at a higher price. The ISBN is 9781512296259.   
  
If you buy the paperback directly from Penny Press you will also be able to download a free electronic book, free shipping and receive free updates of future editions of the ebook.
