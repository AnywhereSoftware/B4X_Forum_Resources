As mobile developers, we all have the frustrating experience of taking our eyes off our smartphone and staring at the PC screen, and vice versa. Microsoft "Phone Link" is a useful Windows app that makes a link between your Android device and your PC and gives you instant access to almost everything on your phone. Using Microsoft "Phone Link", you can have your smartphone screen somewhere at the corner of your PC monitor and at the same time, you can use the PC's keyboard and mouse to interact with the mobile app that is running on the phone.   
  
The steps are so easy:  
1. Use this link: [Launch Phone Link](http://ms-phone://) , or search for "Phone Link" on your Windows taskbar.   
Note: If you are using an outdated Windows 10, you have to download the app from the Microsoft Store. (Although you would better get the updates first!)  
2. Use the QR code to sync your device.  
3. On the top menu, go to Apps -> Open phone screen.  
  
Now, you can run your Android app and see the phone screen on the monitor.
