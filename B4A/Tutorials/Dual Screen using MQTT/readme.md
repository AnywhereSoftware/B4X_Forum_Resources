### Dual Screen using MQTT by aeric

[B4X Forum - B4A - Tutorials](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/167508/)

An example of sending data from device A and display on device B screen using MQTT protocol.  
This is one of the solutions to [this thread](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dual-monitors.149673/page-2#post-949236).  
The code is kept since Aug 2023 but I don't see any one bother to ask how to implement it.  
Today I share it but I hope people have really tried on their own, not waiting to get spoon feed.  
  
Update:  
Version 2 add B4J projects and tested with jMQTT v1.26 and jMqttBroker2ext v2.02 by [USER=125673]@teddybear[/USER]   
  
There is another example using [UDP](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/dual-screen-using-udp.167509/) which I am going to share next.
