I noticed a lot of beginners are confused about how to use the WebViewExtras library so I made a detailed example.  
If you find it useful, kindly consider buying me a coffee.  
  
Code works on Android 4.4 to Android 14 (last tested version). It should work for the latest Android versions but I haven't tested it.  
  
**UPDATE:**  

- Added sample for WebViewExtras v1
- **Added sample for WebViewExtras v2**

  
Maybe if I am free again later I will add a file uploading sample. I haven't tested it well yet so I cannot add it now.
