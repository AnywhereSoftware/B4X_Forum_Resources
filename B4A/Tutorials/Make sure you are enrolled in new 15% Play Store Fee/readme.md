If you receive an email from google announcing the new 15% service fee (instead of 30%) that looks like this:

I was a little confused of why do I have to create a group if I only have one developer account.  
  
Well, you do need to create a group **and click "Add Developer Account" even if you have only one developer account** to properly enroll in the new 15% tier.  
  
Just follow these steps:  
  
When you click the "Create an account Group" link in the email, just name the new group, and you should see your developer account as the "Primary Account".  
  
Then, (I forgot to get a screen shot), at this point there should be a link in the lower right of this screen that says something like "Add Developer Account". You need to Click it even though your developer account is already listed as "Primary" and you have no other developer accounts!  
  
You should then see a screen like this:

Click Save.  
  
Then you should be presented with a "Associated Developers Account" page with a card at the top that says something like "Enroll in 15% fee". Click it and click "Save and Enroll".  
  
At the end, you should be presented again with the "Associated developer Account" page, but now there should be a new card confirming that you are actually enrolled in the 15% tier:

Just make sure you see the above green-checkmark card to confirm you're enrolled.
