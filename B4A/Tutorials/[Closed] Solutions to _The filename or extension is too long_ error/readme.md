**This issue was solved with the** [**B4A 13 Beta 6**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/solved-b4a-v13-0-beta-error-the-filename-or-extension-is-too-long.162138/page-3#post-997620)**.**  
  
I saw many users (include me) with the problem "The filename or extension is too long", when try to compile the project with the new B4A and SDK.  
  
I have 40 projects in Play Store and only 1 got this problem.  
  
I don't saw a example project to reproduce this problem, which I think [is difficult to analysis](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4a-v13-0-beta-error-the-filename-or-extension-is-too-long.162138/#post-994898) by [USER=1]@Erel[/USER].  
  
As there not a only soluction to this problem and every user has your soluction, I list some possible workarounds for this issue:
