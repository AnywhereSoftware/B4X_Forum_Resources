Well,  
  
As JamesGreaves requested,  
"So do you not think it would be of value to have even something like [USER=55689]@walt61[/USER] has created but online?"  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/complete-library-repository-click-here.109921/#post-686347>  
  
I got thinking about it. How hard it is to convert walt61's such a good hard work into online.  
Converting the given xlsm to Google Sheet gave reload error.  
Xls without macro also gave same reload error.  
I made csv and tried to open in sheet, still same error.  
  
Finally I opted for csv to html, <http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-html.htm> and then pasted the html text in a new gsheet. Voila it works !  
  
Please note that the information is Â© walt61 and I will remove the link if not authorised to upload a online version of the same.  
  
I just wanted to help fellow members here with an online option of the same.
