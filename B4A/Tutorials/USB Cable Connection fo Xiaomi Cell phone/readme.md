For anyone who has problems connecting b4a to Xiaomi mobile phones, I make the link available where I found the Google usb driver to connect xiaomi mobile phones to b4a via usb. Download the adb-setup-1.4.3.exe file, run it, the drivers will be installed (Press 'Y'+ Enter, 'Y' +Enter, 'Y' + Enter).  
  
And everything will work out regularly.
