A C# friend who uses MAUI to develop Android apps, but the friend works well, so I recommend him to use B4A, and he got started after a few hours of basic tutorials. He implemented a way to make AES encryption and decryption results consistent across B4X and .NET platforms. I converted the VB.NET code based on his C# code. The source files are attached.

He uses this feature in his own note-taking software. This is his software website: <http://www.lesliexin.com/>
