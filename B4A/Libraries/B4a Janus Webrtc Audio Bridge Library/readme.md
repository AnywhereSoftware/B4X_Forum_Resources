Hello everyone. if you are familiar with Janus Webrtc server then this library might be useful for you.  
if you want to read more about meetecho janus gateway you can find it on this [github](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway).  
  
This is not a wrapper or any kind of ready to compile Project.  
This Project is made with curiosity From A To Z. starting from android studio codebase to the last piece of the code logic.  
that's why this library is not for free. since there is many efforts and time has been given to make this library possible to b4a.
