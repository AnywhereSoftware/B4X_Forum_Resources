### Heart Rate Measurement - 100% embedded in B4A by Johan Schoeman

[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/112554/)

The request came [**from here**](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/wrap-android-library-heart-rate-measurement.112543/#post-701653) but making it open to anyone that wants to use it. It is for freeâ€¦  
  
Copy the attached jar's and xml's to your additional libs folder. Have used some old camera wrapper code that I have used before along with the AndroidPlot wrapper that I have also done long ago + some code from [**here**](https://github.com/SachinVin/Heart-rate-monitor-android) to create a lib and B4A sample project that measures and displays heart rate using the back facing camera and flash/torch.  
  
Not sure if the camera orientation is going to be correct on all devices but it is not important as the lib is really only interested in the change in RED when your finger covers the camera and the preview is active (and torch is on).
