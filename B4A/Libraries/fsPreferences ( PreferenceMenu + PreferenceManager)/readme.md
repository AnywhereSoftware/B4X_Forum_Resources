Hi,  
  
I hereby make my updated library available to all.  
In the example all necessary functions are included.  
  
The file "fsPreferences.xml" and "fsPreferences.jar" must be saved under "C:\Program Files\Anywhere Software\B4a\Extern-Library" or similar.  
  
You can make each entry dependent on another entry, and it doesn't matter if it is the first or the last entry.  
  
You can find the version for B4i here.  
  
For questions or help, please write [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/fspreferences-preferencemenu-preferencemanager.144398/).  
  
Ciao,  
Filippo
