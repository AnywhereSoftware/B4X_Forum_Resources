ConsentManager SDK was removed from FirebaseAdMob2 as it can cause the app to be rejected in some cases (child directed apps).  
Google recommends using User Messaging Platform instead: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/adshelper-extends-firebaseadmob2-google-mobile-ads-v20-0.129696/#content>  
  
The attached library includes the old consent SDK and allows using it together with FirebaseAdmob2.
