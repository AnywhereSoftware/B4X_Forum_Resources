Hello,  
  
The class clsPopupMenu shows a Popup Menu which can own sub menus.  
  
The options are stored in a map. In the example they are in json file in the assets folder.  
  
3 events are fired :  
  
- open : A popup menu has been opened  
- click : An option has been clicked  
- close : A popup menu has been closed  
  
You can customize the layout clsPopupMenu.bal for yours needs.
