[HEADING=1]Public API[/HEADING]  
  
[HEADING=2]Adding Items[/HEADING]  
  

```B4X
' Add a layout file as a card (the layout fills the card)  
SwipeCard1.AddLayout("CardProduct", "prod-123")  
  
' Wrap an existing Panel (will be moved into the card)  
SwipeCard1.AddPanel(SomePanel, "custom-01")
```

  
  
**[SIZE=6]Stack / Threshold / Durations[/SIZE]**  
  

```B4X
SwipeCard1.SetStack(3, 4dip, 8dip)      ' maxVisible, dx, dy  
SwipeCard1.SetThresholdPct(0.30)        ' 30% of width  
SwipeCard1.SetDurations(220, 180)       ' snapMs, flingMs
```

  
  
**[SIZE=6]Query / Remove / Clear[/SIZE]**  
  

```B4X
Log(SwipeCard1.Count)                   ' total items  
Log(SwipeCard1.CurrentItemId)           ' id of the top card (or "")  
Dim removed As Boolean = SwipeCard1.RemoveById("prod-123")  
SwipeCard1.Clear                         ' removes all cards
```

  
  
[HEADING=1]Events[/HEADING]  
  
The class raises up to three events (all with **one String parameter**: the card Id):  
  
  

- SwipeCard\_LeftSwipe (Id As String)
- SwipeCard\_RightSwipe (Id As String)
- SwipeCard\_CenterRelease (Id As String)

  
**Example:**  
  

```B4X
Private Sub SwipeCard1_LeftSwipe (Id As String)  
    Log($"Left ‚Üí ${Id}"$)  
    ' TODO: Dislike, skip, etc.  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub SwipeCard1_RightSwipe (Id As String)  
    Log($"Right ‚Üí ${Id}"$)  
    ' TODO: Like, approve, etc.  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub SwipeCard1_CenterRelease (Id As String)  
    Log($"Release (center) ‚Üí ${Id}"$)  
    ' Optional: snap-back finished  
End Sub
```

  
  
  
[HEADING=1]Quick Start (B4XPages)[/HEADING]  
  

1. **Add the class file** SwipeCard.bas to your project.
2. In **B4XPages** Main Page (B4XMainPage):

  
  

```B4X
Sub Class_Globals  
    Private Root As B4XView  
    Private Swipe As SwipeCard  
End Sub  
  
Public Sub Initialize As Object  
    Return Me  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub B4XPage_Created (Root1 As B4XView)  
    Root = Root1  
    Root.LoadLayout("MainPage")  ' Contains a Panel placeholder: pnlHost  
    ' Or build in code:  
    Swipe.Initialize(Me, "SwipeCard")  
    Root.AddView(Swipe.mBase, 0, 0, Root.Width, Root.Height)  
  
    ' Add cards  
    For i = 1 To 5  
        Swipe.AddLayout("CardItem", $"item-${i}"$)  
    Next  
  
    ' Optional tuning  
    Swipe.SetStack(3, 4dip, 8dip)  
    Swipe.SetThresholdPct(0.28)  
    Swipe.SetDurations(200, 170)  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub Root_Resize (Width As Double, Height As Double)  
    If Swipe.IsInitialized Then Swipe.mBase.SetLayoutAnimated(0, 0, 0, Width, Height)  
End Sub
```

  
  
**CardItem.bal tip:** Design to fill parent. The class ensures the child view stretches to card bounds.

[HEADING=1]Usage Patterns[/HEADING]  
  
[HEADING=2]1) Dynamic Data (e.g., Products, Profiles)[/HEADING]  
  

```B4X
For Each rec As Map In DataList  
    ' Load same layout for each; bind labels/images inside that layout  
    Swipe.AddLayout("CardProfile", rec.Get("id"))  
Next
```

  
  
**[SIZE=6]After AddLayout, you can access the child view via:[/SIZE]**  
  

```B4X
' Inside the class, child is Panel.GetView(0). Outside, prefer to bind in layout load events.
```

  
  
**[SIZE=6]2) Removing / Skipping Specific Cards[/SIZE]**  
  
  
  

```B4X
If Swipe.RemoveById("custom-01") = False Then Log("Id not found!")
```

  
  
  
[HEADING=2]3) Programmatic ‚ÄúLike/Dislike‚Äù[/HEADING]  
  
This class focuses on **gesture-driven** swipes. If you want programmatic swipe, you can either:  
  
  

- Trigger the animation by manually setting Panel.Left and calling the internal release logic (extend the class to expose a SwipeLeft/SwipeRight method), **or**
- Simulate user flow by removing the top card and calling UpdateStack (simpler but no fling animation).

  
**Example extension (inside class):**  
  

```B4X
' Public method (optional): fling top programmatically to the right  
Public Sub FlingRight  
    If Items.Size = 0 Or CurrentIndex > Items.Size - 1 Or isAnimating Then Return  
    Dim top As TItem = Items.Get(CurrentIndex)  
    isAnimating = True  
    top.Panel.SetLayoutAnimated(FlingDuration, mBase.Width + 50dip, top.Panel.Top, top.Panel.Width, top.Panel.Height)  
    Sleep(FlingDuration)  
    isAnimating = False  
    RaiseEvent("RightSwipe", top.Id)  
    top.Panel.Visible = False  
    top.Panel.RemoveViewFromParent  
    Items.RemoveAt(CurrentIndex)  
    UpdateStack  
End Sub
```

  
  
[HEADING=1]Performance Notes[/HEADING]  
  

- **Images:** Prefer pre-scaled images sized close to card bounds (avoid huge bitmaps on mobile).
- **Animations:** Current defaults (FlingDuration=180, SnapDuration=220) feel snappy. Increase slightly on older devices.
- **Touch throttling:** throttleMs=8 reduces event flood while maintaining smoothness.
- **Rotation cap:** MaxRotation=12 degrees max; adjust if you want flatter/more dramatic tilt.
- **B4A Hardware Acceleration:** Usually on by default‚Äîkeep it enabled for smoother animation.

[HEADING=1]Compatibility[/HEADING]  
  

- **B4A:** Android 5.0+ recommended
- **B4i:** iOS 12+ recommended
- **B4J:** Works in principle; touch handling depends on your setup (mouse drag maps fine)

[HEADING=1]Troubleshooting[/HEADING]  
  
**Card doesn‚Äôt fill the container**  
Ensure the SwipeCard‚Äôs mBase is sized to its parent (use Base\_Resize or set anchors in Designer). Your child layout should be ‚Äúmatch parent‚Äù.  
  
  
**No events firing**  
Check that your subs match the event names:  
<EventName>\_LeftSwipe, <EventName>\_RightSwipe, <EventName>\_CenterRelease.  
  
  
**Laggy drag**  
  
  

- Avoid heavy work during Touch MOVE.
- Reduce image sizes or complex nested views in card layouts.
- Slightly increase throttleMs to ~10‚Äì12.

  
**I need vertical swipes**  
Current version supports **horizontal** swipes. For vertical, fork and adapt the drag axis (use Y instead of Left, and rotate around X/Z as desired).

```B4X
' In MainPage  
Private Swipe As SwipeCard  
  
Sub B4XPage_Created (Root1 As B4XView)  
    Root = Root1  
    Swipe.Initialize(Me, "SwipeCard")  
    Root.AddView(Swipe.mBase, 0, 0, Root.Width, Root.Height)  
  
    For i = 1 To 4  
        Swipe.AddLayout("CardSimple", $"id-${i}"$)  
    Next  
End Sub  
  
Sub SwipeCard_RightSwipe (Id As String)  
    Log($"‚úÖ Liked: ${Id}"$)  
End Sub  
  
Sub SwipeCard_LeftSwipe (Id As String)  
    Log($"‚ùå Disliked: ${Id}"$)  
End Sub  
  
Sub SwipeCard_CenterRelease (Id As String)  
    Log($"‚Ü©Ô∏è Returned: ${Id}"$)  
End Sub
```
