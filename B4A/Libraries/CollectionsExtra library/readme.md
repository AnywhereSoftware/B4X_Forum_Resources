This library provides a LinkedList object which is an implementation of a doubly linked list that can be used as a stack, queue, or double-ended queue.  
  
It also includes an ArraysExtra object that allows arrays to be partially or fully copied, cloned, partially or fully filled with a given value, sorted and searched. ArraysExtra can also return, using the ToString method, a comma separated string representation of the contents of an array of Strings or of a primitive type.
