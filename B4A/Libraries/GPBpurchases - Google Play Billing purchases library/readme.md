[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/163830/)

This library makes shopping on the Play Store very easy. It wraps the entire billing functionality. Just a few settings and the user can shop items. All necessary data is downloaded from the Google Play Console. Therefore, it is very important to choose the correct name and description of the purchased item in GPC. In-app items appear first, then subscriptions. Subscriptions are displayed including phases. Behavior can be set in the Designer, including colors.  
After a successful purchase, the PurchaseCompleted event is raised, where you can set the user's permissions.  
The principle of using the library is in the sample application.
