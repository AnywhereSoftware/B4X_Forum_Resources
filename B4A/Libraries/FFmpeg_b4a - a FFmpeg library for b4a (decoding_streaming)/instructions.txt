Beta FFMpeg_b4a wrapper by Moster67 (Mikael Osterhed) 
Beta-release date: September 6, 2014

Instructions:

1)In your B4A-project (refer to the included demo in this zip-file), under Project attributes, add 2 lines as follows:
#AdditionalRes: C:\testingb4a\testffmpeg\ijkmediaplayer\res, tv.danmaku.ijk.media.player
#AdditionalRes: C:\testingb4a\testffmpeg\ijkmediawidget\res, tv.danmaku.ijk.media.widget

IMPORTANT - Replace "C:\testingb4a\testffmpeg\ijkmediaplayer\res" 
and "C:\testingb4a\testffmpeg\ijkmediawidget\res" 
with the path to your folder where you saved the supplied res-folders on your PC
The res-folders are included in this zip-file.

2) Copy the libraries (ijkmediaplayer.jar and ijkmediawidget.jar) included in this zip-file to your B4A extra-library folder. 

3) The other necessary libraries are available as separate downloads on the forum. Copy also these libraries (jar-files and xml-files) into your B4A extra-library folder.

4) In B4A (in the the libs-tab), remember to tick the correct version of the FFMpeg_b4a library you want to use in your project. With this beta, I am furnishing on purpose separate versions of the library according to cpu architecture (FFMpeg_B4A_armeabi-v7a.jar, FFMpeg_B4A_armeabi.jar and FFMpeg_B4A_x86.jar). Final version will include all libraries in one single library.
