One of the best game engines for Android is now available to B4A users. Unleash your creativity!  
  
You can read a description of this library in [this guide](http://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/introduction-to-the-libgdx-library.32592/).  
  
[**Download for B4A v10.60 and older (4 MB)**](https://www.b4x.com/android/files/libgdx/LibGDX_1_13.zip)  
[**Download for B4A v10.70 and newer (4 MB)**](https://www.b4x.com/android/files/libgdx/LibGDX_1_14.zip)  
  
**Starting from version 1.13, the library is compiled with Java 8, and thus requires a recent version of B4A and Java 8+.**  
To install the library, copy the .jar file and the .xml file in your libraries folder.  
  
**This library is not compatible with the Debug mode.** Ensure that you always compile in Release mode.  
  
Download also the [**examples and templates**](http://www.b4x.com/android/files/libgdx/Examples_Templates_1_14.zip).  
  
You can reduce the weight of the library if you want to keep your APK file as small as possible. Read [this post](http://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/libgdx.32594/page-13#post-257648) to learn how to create your Lite version.
