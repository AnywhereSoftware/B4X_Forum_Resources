Introduction
------------

Before extracting the BasicIDE.zip project file it should be  unlocked by right clicking on it in File Explorer, selecting Properties and checking Unblock at the lower right of the General tab.

The file Template.b4s should be copied to the Objects folder in the project and then to wherever BalToBasicIDE.jar is located.


Help
----

Look in the Help folder in the project folder for more help. If the compiled help file will not display properly then the BasicIDE.zip file was not unlocked before extraction. Either go back and do that or unclock the help file.
