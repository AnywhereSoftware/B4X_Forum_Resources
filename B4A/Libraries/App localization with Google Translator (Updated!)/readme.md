Minor BugFixes- Read in manual mode = manual input of requested language.
- Read in automatic mode = requested language depends on device locale.

**Notice!**  
Translation is done with the currently free help of Google Translater via Internet connection. If Master Translation Excel File did the translation we convert this file into an Excel 97-2003 file without macro. This file is beeing used to fill global map 'localization' with the translated text to use it offline. The map or Database now serves the text for the GUI Views.  
Some parts of the solution are based on work of other developers. Please see copyright info inside manual.  
  
Find the **Manual** in the Folder translatingExcel as Text or RTF File. Here the **Master Excel File with the macros** is also saved.
