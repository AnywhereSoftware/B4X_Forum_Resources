Hi All,  
  
This custom view class will act as a button with ripple effect when clicked, it also has water effect if you swipe/move the pointer onto the view.  
This class was inspired by [SwiftButton](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-views-cross-platform-views-and-dialogs.100836/) (Part of XUI Views) and also advice from this [post](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/create-ripple-effect-inside-panel.120304/post-752275) to make the code more customizable properties.  
  
Since i don't have B4I installed on my PC the class not tested for iOS.  
  
This class require additional library:  
- XUI (2.00)  
- B4A - BitmapCreator (4.73)  
- B4J - jBitmapCreator (4.73)

\*It's better and smoother when run on real device  
  
I hope everyone find it useful.
