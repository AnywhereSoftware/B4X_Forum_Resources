Hi guys?  
Another B4A Library : **Alimo\_BottomNavigation** .  
With this library, you can create 3 models of bottom navigation with **Simple** , **Morph** and **Meow** modes , and enjoy its many personalizations.  
  
**Simple mode** : In this mode, there is no curve and circular shape in it.  
**Morph mode** : In this mode, a curve is placed on top of your item parent and a circular shape is placed inside it.  
**Meow mode** : In this case, a curve is placed inside the parent of your items and a circular shape is placed inside it.
