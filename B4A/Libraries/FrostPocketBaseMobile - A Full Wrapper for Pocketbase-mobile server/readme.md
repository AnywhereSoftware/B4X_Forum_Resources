**Hello B4X Community,**  
  
I'm excited to share a new library I've wrapped for B4A developers. [FrostPocketBaseMobile](https://github.com/frostcodes/PocketBase-Mobile-for-B4A) is a B4A wrapper around the [Pocketbase-mobile](https://github.com/rohitsangwan01/pocketbase_mobile) library by Rohit Sangwan. This wrapper brings the power of a **Pocketbase Server** to your B4A projects, allowing you to easily integrate a lightweight, self-hosted backend into your Android apps.  
  
[HEADING=2]Features[/HEADING]  

- **REST API and Admin UI:** Access the Pocketbase REST API and Admin UI from your Android device.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Pocketbase is designed to be a lightweight solution that runs efficiently on your Android device.
