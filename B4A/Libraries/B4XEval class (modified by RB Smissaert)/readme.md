Posted this in the questions group, slightly altered this class (posted originally by Erel) so that it will handle any (?) faulty input string and not  
produce an unhandled error. Requested to put this in this group and attached a simple B4XPages project demonstrating this.  
  
Posted by zipping the project like this:  
'Ctrl + click to export as zip: ide://run?File=%B4X%\Zipper.jar&Args=\%PROJECT\_NAME%.zip  
  
As zipping the actual project folder made the file too big to upload.
