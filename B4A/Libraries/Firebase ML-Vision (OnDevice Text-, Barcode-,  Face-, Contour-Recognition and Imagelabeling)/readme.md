Setup:  
- Start the B4A SDKManager and update all recommended items. The Manager should download all Firebase-ML-Itemsâ€¦  
- Follow the Firebaseintegration tutorial for the needed Manifestentries.  
- Add this lines to your Mainmodule  

```B4X
#AdditionalJar: com.google.android.gms:play-services-base  
#AdditionalJar: com.google.android.gms:play-services-tasks  
#AdditionalJar: com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision  
#AdditionalJar: com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision-face-model

#AdditionalJar: com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-common  
#AdditionalJar: com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-model-interpreter
```

  
- Create a layout with a CameraSourcePreview and a GraphicOverlay

Known issues:  
- I was not able to setup a detector for detecting an Image as of now. For now only the live detection is included.  
  
Notes:  
- The Included methods are ALL using "OnDevice-Recognition". For the ondevice-recognition a Free Firebase account should be OK.  
- I can implement also the Cloud-Methods i guess.But you need to have a PAID plan to use them. As of now no Cloudmethods are implemented/supported.
