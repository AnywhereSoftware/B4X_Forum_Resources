[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/167017/)

I made this with the help of Grock and ChatGPT and decided to share it here so everybody can use it in their projects.  
  
For now, it supports these languages:  

- B4X
- Java
- XML
- PHP
- SQL
- Python
- JavaScript

But there is room for more  
  
if you want to show B4X code, you need to use a text file, but if the code is retrieved from the host, just store it in a string, and it will show all of it.  
  
If you had any suggestions to improve this class, be free to do it, and share it for others to use as well.
