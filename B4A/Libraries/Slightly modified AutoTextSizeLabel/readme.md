Hi everyone, for necessity i added some fields to the famous [AutoTextSizeLabel class](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-xui-autotextsizelabel.100187/).  
The fields added are:  
  
**Version 1.4**  

- **Access Tag Property**: You can now use the .Tag property to set/access this value also from designer

**Version 1.3**  

- **Min Text Size**: Specify the minium size of the text of the label (less than this can't go)
- **Max Text Size**: Specify the minium size of the text of the label (more than this can't go)
- **Ignore User Font Scale**: Specify if the label should ignore the fact that the user could have widened the interface (n.b. default: True)

  
maybe that are dumb changes, but to me were useful, so.. here you are.  
  
Bye
