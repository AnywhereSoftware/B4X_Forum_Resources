[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/130104/)

A customer asked me to implement this feature for some purposes. Gone through the forum and internet the old libary doesnt work anymore from api 17. And Github hasnt also nothing new.  
Attached a example with B4xPages and new library needed.  
  
nb i needed to inline java the *import android.content.Context;*   
otherwise you will get a compile error. Dont know why, maybe somebody has a better solution.
