**Spatialite wraps the [splite-android](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/wiki?name=splite-android) project enabling you to create databases with geo-spatial features and make queries using geo-spatial functions.**  
  
Spatialite is an enhancement of the SQLite database.  
It has dedicated column data types for spatial features: Points, Polylines and Polygons, and various query functions that enable fast and efficient retrieval of spatial data from the database.  
The official reference for version 3.0.0 of spatialite can be found here: <http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/spatialite-sql-3.0.0.html>.  
(The B4A spatialite library is based on version 3.0.1 of spatialite).  
  
**Spatialite  
Comment:** Spatialite is an SQLite extension for the Android platform.  
Currently version 3.0.1 of Spatialite is wrapped by this library.  
Spatialite is compiled using geos v3.3.6 and proj4 v4.8.0 patched.  
**Version:** 1.10

*Please note that i have only tested a small number of the library objects, if you find any bugs please post a bug report and i'll do my best to fix it.*  
  
The Spatialite.jar library file is over 14MBs in size so too large to attach to a forum post.  
So you can find the library files here: <http://b4a.martinpearman.co.uk/spatialite/> (Spatialite\_library\_files\_v2.20.zip).  
Also available at that link is SpatialiteGUI - a small Windows utility that will likely be very handy for you developers.
