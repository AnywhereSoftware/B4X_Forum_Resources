### aPOI - A wrapper for jPOI for Android - reading and writing XLS, XLSX on Android 5+ by DonManfred
### 03/01/2020
[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/110652/)

This is a wrap for [this Github project](https://github.com/andruhon/android5xlsx) which is itself a wrap for jPOI.  
  
Reading and Writing XLSX on Android 5 Reading and Writing XLSX and XLS on Android 5 with Apache POI  
  
It was quite a challenging task to use Apache POI on android with Dalvik VM. It is much easier to use Apache POI on Android 5+ with ART VM and Build Tools 21+  
  
Please refer to <https://github.com/andruhon/AndroidReadXLSX> if you need to read XLSX on Android 4 with Dalvik VM.  
  
#Contents I've repacked poi-ooxml to contain all dependencies in order to read and write XLSX (XLS as well, obviously) All javax classes from the STAX library and calls to them are renamed to aavax, to avoid â€“core-library warning and conflicts.  
  

- poi-3.12-android-a.jar //Repacked POI with all dependencies
- poi-ooxml-schemas-3.12-20150511-a.jar //original schemas jar

Note that the b4a wrap is far from being complete! Only a few Objects are wrapped as yet.  
The Sheet, SheetRows and SheetColumns.  
  
i guess there are hundrets of Objects missing.  
For simple reading and writing it should work. I hope :D
