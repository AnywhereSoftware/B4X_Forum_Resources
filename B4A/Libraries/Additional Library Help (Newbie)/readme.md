[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/144566/)

I just downloaded B4x today. Tried to do the first tutorial and I am having a compiling error on b4J with folder location. I think it is due to my path config. I have the javac.exe setup right but additional libraries is blank. I have looked on the B4X website to see were I can download these libraries but it only tells me about them. Not how to download and where to place them in me file explorer. If someone can point me in the right direction to download these libraries that would be awesome!
