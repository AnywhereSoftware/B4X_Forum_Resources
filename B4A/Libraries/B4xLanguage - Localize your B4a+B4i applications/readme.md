Hi guys,  
  
I would like to present today my B4xLanguage application, with which you can manage the different languages likely your own apps.  
My solution is based on:  
1. B4xLanguage.exe (Windows-Application)  
 The B4x-Language folder can be saved to any folder.  
 With this application the database is filled with the different languages.  
 The database "language.dbx" can be opened/edited with a double click, provided that the extension is linked to the application "B4xLanguage.exe".  
2. SQLite-Database  
 The finished database must be saved under File.DirAssets.  
3. The classe clsLanguage.bas is already included in the example - one for B4a and one for B4i.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to write here.  
  
**Update to Version 1.022**  
Some German texts that had no translations have now been translated.  
The "Translate" button is disabled and does not work at the moment. I want to create an account at DeepL soon so I can test it.  
If it works, then everyone can use this application with its own Api-key from DeepL.
