I am trying to build an app that stores a database file in google drive. In order for the app to access google drive. GoogleAuth2 is needed. But I am getting an error that, "Attribute not supported: event" in the GoogleOauth2 which I got from the Thread: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-b4x-google-oauth2.79426/>. I am using the suggested file which is separate from the zip files.  
  
I have by no means completed the application moreover I am a neophyte in B4a.
