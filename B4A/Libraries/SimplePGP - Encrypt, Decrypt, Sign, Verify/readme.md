[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/89521/)

This is a wrap around this [Github-project](https://github.com/sniggle/simple-pgp).  
It wraps the Android Part of it using some additional jars from bouncycastle and spongycastle for the Encryption Provider  
  
A B4J Version is [available here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/simplepgp-encrypt-decrypt-sign-verify.89523/).  
  
I just did it out of curiosity :)  
Based on the Size of the Additional jars you need to download them [[SIZE=6]here[/SIZE]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifh1mhwvg1tqjnr/SimplePGP.7z?dl=1).  
  
**SimplePGP  
Author: DonManfred (wrapper)  
Version:** 1.0  

- **PGPKeyPairGenerator**

- **Functions:**

- **generateKeyPair** (userId As String, password As String, publicKey As java.io\_OutputStream, secrectKey As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
- **generateKeyPair2** (userId As String, password As String, keySize As Int, publicKey As java.io\_OutputStream, secrectKey As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
 *userId: the user id for the PGP key pair  
 password: the password used to secure the secret (private) key  
 keySize: the custom key size  
 publicKey: the target stream for the public key  
 secrectKey: the target stream for the secret (private) key  
 Return type: @return:*- **Initialize** (EventName As String)

- **PGPMessageEncryptor**

- **Functions:**

- **decrypt** (passwordOfReceiversPrivateKey As String, privateKeyOfReceiver As java.io.InputStream, encryptedData As java.io.InputStream, target As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
- **decrypt2** (passwordOfReceiversPrivateKey As String, privateKeyOfReceiver As java.io.InputStream, publicKeyOfSender As java.io.InputStream, encryptedData As java.io.InputStream, target As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
- **encrypt** (publicKeyOfRecipient As java.io.InputStream, inputDataName As String, plainInputData As java.io.InputStream, target As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
- **encrypt2** (publicKeyOfRecipient As java.io.InputStream, privateKeyOfSender As java.io.InputStream, userIdOfSender As String, passwordOfSendersPrivateKey As String, plainInputData As java.io.InputStream, inputDataName As String, target As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
- **init** (arg0 As Boolean, params As org.spongycastle.crypto.CipherParameters)
- **Initialize** (EventName As String)
- **messageDecrypt** (arg0 As Byte()) As Byte()
- **messageEncrypt** (arg0 As Byte()) As Byte()

- **PGPMessageSigner**

- **Functions:**

- **Initialize** (EventName As String)
- **signMessage** (privateKeyOfSender As java.io.InputStream, userIdForPrivateKey As String, passwordOfPrivateKey As String, message As java.io.InputStream, signature As java.io\_OutputStream) As Boolean
- **verifyMessage** (publicKeyOfSender As java.io.InputStream, message As java.io.InputStream, signatureStream As java.io.InputStream) As Boolean

- **Properties:**

- **CompressionAlgorithm** As Int [write only]
- **UnlimitedEncryptionStrength** As Boolean [write only]
