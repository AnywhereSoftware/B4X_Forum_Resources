Busy wrapping [**this project**](https://github.com/xcltapestry/XCL-Charts). It offers some unique graphs / charts. Will post the **3D** bar chart sometime before the end of this coming weekend. It will allow for a 3D chart consisting of a series of 5 graphs. You can also pinch zoom the graph and pan/scroll/drag the graph to the left and right. It also incorporates a "tooltip" that will display the value of a bar when the bar is touched. Some sample snapshots:
