This library is an addition to the **OSMDroid 6** library. Contains additional classes and methods for **geocoding, reverse geocoding, POIs, Routing** and others. This library is based on the original GitHub library version **6.9.0**, but I had to rework some classes due to deprecation to make them functional.  
  
This library is dependent on the parent **OSMDroid 6** library and cannot be used separately. You can download the **OSMDroid 6** library from this [link](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/osmdroid-6.147200/).  
  
If this libraries makes your work easier and saves time in creating your application, please make a donation.
