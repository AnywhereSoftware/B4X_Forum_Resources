[HEADING=2]Security[/HEADING]  
The API employs several security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your data:  
  

- **Authentication:** All API requests require an API key to be included as a query parameter. This key uniquely identifies the client making the request and provides access control to the API endpoints.
- **HTTPS:** Communication with the API is always encrypted over HTTPS, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and the server remains confidential.
- **Input validation:** The API performs input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

[HEADING=2]Base URL[/HEADING]  
<http://example.com/api.php>  
[HEADING=2]Authentication[/HEADING]  
The API uses an API key for authentication. The API key must be included as a parameter in all requests.  
  
[HEADING=3]Authentication Parameters[/HEADING]  

- api\_key (required): The API key to authenticate the request.

[HEADING=2]**Notes**[/HEADING]  

- Both routines provide asynchronous operations, and results are returned via their respective events.
- Error handling is embedded, and failed operations trigger the appropriate event with a success = False.
- Ensure the data maps are properly initialized and contain valid column names and values for the target table.

[HEADING=2]üìÇ **Important Update for Magic API File Management** üöÄ[/HEADING]  
We‚Äôre introducing an **enhanced file and folder management system** with the latest version of Magic API! Here's how it works:  
  

---

  
[HEADING=2]**File and Folder Operations in Magic API**[/HEADING]  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Default Folder: upload**  
  

- All files and folders you create or interact with will be managed inside a new folder named **upload**.
- This folder will be **automatically created** the first time you upload a file.

üìç **Location**: The upload folder will be created in the same directory as the files.php script on your server.  
  

---

  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Automatic Folder Creation**  
  

- When you add a file to a specific folder, Magic API will **automatically create the folder** if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.
- This ensures seamless operations, eliminating the need for manual folder setup.

---

  
[HEADING=2]**Examples**[/HEADING]  
[HEADING=3]**Uploading a File to the Default Folder**[/HEADING]  
When uploading a file without specifying a folder, it will be stored directly in the **upload** folder.  
  

```B4X
MagicFiles.UploadFile(File.DirRootExternal, "example.txt")  
  
Wait For MagicFiles_UploadResult(Success As Boolean, FileName As String)  
  
If Success Then  
Log($"File ${FileName} uploaded successfully to the 'upload' folder."$)  
Else  
Log("Error uploading the file.")  
End If
```

  
  

---

  
[HEADING=3]**Uploading a File to a Specific Folder**[/HEADING]  
If you specify a folder, Magic API will automatically create it if it doesn‚Äôt exist.  
  

```B4X
MagicFiles.UploadFileToFolder(File.DirRootExternal, "document.pdf", "tasks", "report.pdf")  
  
Wait For MagicFiles_UploadToFolderResult(Success As Boolean, FileName As String)  
  
If Success Then  
Log($"File ${FileName} uploaded successfully to the 'tasks' folder."$)  
Else  
Log("Error uploading the file.")  
End If
```

  
  

---

  
[HEADING=2]**Why This Update?**[/HEADING]  
‚úÖ **Automated Management**: No need to manually create folders. Magic API does it for you!  
‚úÖ **Simplified Operations**: Focus on your app logic while the API handles the backend file structure.  
‚úÖ **Consistency**: All file operations are neatly organized within the upload folder.  
  

---

  
[HEADING=2]**Note**[/HEADING]  

- All file and folder operations (e.g., uploading, deleting, listing) will now occur inside the **upload** folder for better organization and security.
- If you interact with a folder that doesn‚Äôt exist, it will be created automatically.
