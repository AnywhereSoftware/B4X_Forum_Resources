**API Documentation  
  
Security**  
  
The API employs several security measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your data:  
  
  
  

- **Authentication:** All API requests require an API key to be included as a query parameter. This key uniquely identifies the client making the request and provides access control to the API endpoints.
- **HTTPS:** Communication with the API is always encrypted over HTTPS, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and the server remains confidential.
- **Input validation:** The API performs input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Base URL**  
  
<http://example.com/api.php>  
  
**Authentication**  
  
The API uses an API key for authentication. The API key must be included as a parameter in all requests.  
  
  
  
**Authentication Parameters**  
  

- api\_key (required): The API key to authenticate the request.

üåü Ultimate Guide: Manage Any MySQL Database with DatabaseAPI and api.php in B4X**  
  
  
  
Welcome, developers! This guide shows you how to use the B4X DatabaseAPI class with the api.php script to interact with **any MySQL database** in a simple, secure, and efficient way. We provide practical examples for each method, both in B4X and direct API calls using cURL, along with instructions for configuring connection variables, security measures, and the advantages of using this API. üöÄ  
  
  
  
  
  
**üõ†Ô∏è Initial Setup  
  
  
  
Server and api.php Configuration**  
  
  
  
Before uploading api.php to your server, edit the connection variables to match your MySQL environment:  
  
  
  
  
  
php  
  
  
  
// Database connection parameters  
  
$servername = "localhost"; // Change to your MySQL server address (e.g., "mysql.yourserver.com")  
  
$username = "root"; // Change to your database user  
  
$password = ""; // Change to the user‚Äôs password  
  
$dbname = "inventory\_system"; // Default database  
  
$apiKey = '1234'; // Change to a secure, unique API key  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Steps to upload to the server**:  
  
  
  
  
  

1. Open api.php in a text editor.
2. Update $servername, $username, $password, and $apiKey to match your setup.
3. Optionally, set a default database in $dbname if you don‚Äôt plan to use the dbname parameter in requests.
4. Upload api.php to your web server‚Äôs root directory (e.g., /public\_html/api.php or C:\xampp\htdocs\api.php for a local server).
5. Ensure your server has PHP and MySQL enabled.

  
  
**API Security**  
  
  
  
The API implements several security measures to protect your data:  
  
  
  
  
  

- **API Key Authentication**: All requests require an api\_key parameter (e.g., 1234). Change $apiKey in api.php to a unique, secure value and store it safely.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses prepared statements (mysqli::prepare) and data escaping (real\_escape\_string) to prevent SQL injections.
- **Query Restriction**: Custom queries (custom\_query) are restricted to SELECT statements to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **CORS Configuration**: Allows requests from any origin (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \*), but you can restrict it to specific domains for enhanced security (e.g., Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <https://yourdomain.com>).
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: Ensures compatibility with special characters and avoids encoding issues.
- **No Caching**: Headers like Cache-Control and Expires prevent responses from being cached, reducing risks of accessing outdated data.

  
  
**Security Recommendations**:  
  
  
  
  
  

- Use a strong, unique API key (e.g., a generated hash).
- Enable HTTPS on your server to encrypt communications.
- Restrict MySQL user permissions to the minimum required (e.g., read/write only for the specific database).
- Consider adding a firewall or .htaccess rules to limit access to api.php.

  
  
**Advantages of Using the API**  
  
  
  

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: As a RESTful API, api.php can be used from any platform or language (B4X, JavaScript, Python, etc.) via HTTP requests, making it ideal for mobile, web, or desktop applications.
- **Database Flexibility**: Connect to any MySQL database by specifying the dbname parameter in the URL, without modifying server code.
- **Scalability**: Supports complex operations like batch inserts, table joins, and custom queries, suitable for large-scale projects.
- **Easy Integration**: The DatabaseAPI class simplifies interactions in B4X, while standard HTTP calls allow integration with other technologies.
- **Robust Security**: Includes authentication, SQL injection prevention, and HTTPS support for secure operations.
- **Simple Maintenance**: The modular design of api.php and DatabaseAPI makes updates and customizations straightforward.

  
  
**Sample Database**  
  
  
  
For the examples, we use a test database called inventory\_system. Create the tables with this SQL (in phpMyAdmin or MySQL console):  
  
  
  
  
  

```B4X
CREATE DATABASE inventory_system;  
  
USE inventory_system;  
  
  
  
CREATE TABLE products (  
  
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
  
name VARCHAR(255),  
  
price DECIMAL(10,2),  
  
stock INT,  
  
category_id INT  
  
);  
  
  
  
CREATE TABLE categories (  
  
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
  
category_name VARCHAR(255)  
  
);  
  
  
  
‚Äì Sample data  
  
INSERT INTO products (name, price, stock, category_id) VALUES  
  
('Laptop', 999.99, 10, 1),  
  
('Mouse', 29.99, 50, 2),  
  
('Keyboard', 59.99, 20, 2);  
  
  
  
INSERT INTO categories (category_name) VALUES  
  
('Electronics'),  
  
('Accessories');
```

  
  
  
  
**Note**: You can use any database by specifying dbname in requests (e.g., ?dbname=my\_database).  
  
  
  
**B4X Configuration**  
  
  
  
Initialize the DatabaseAPI class with your database name in the URL:  
  
  
  
  
  

```B4X
Sub Process_Globals  
  
Private db As DatabaseAPI  
  
End Sub  
  
  
  
Sub AppStart  
  
db.Initialize(Me, "DB", "http://localhost/api.php?dbname=inventory_system", "YOUR APIKEY")  
  
End Sub
```

  
  
  
  
  
  
**Requirements**  
  
  
  

- **Server**: Ensure api.php is in the server‚Äôs root directory (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\api.php for XAMPP).
- **API Key**: Use 1234 or the key defined in api.php.
- **Testing**: Use Postman, cURL, or a terminal to test direct API calls.

**üéâ Implementation Tips**  
  
  
  

- **Flexibility**: Use the dbname parameter in the URL to connect to any database (e.g., <http://localhost/api.php?dbname=my_database>).
- **Testing**: Test cURL calls with Postman or a terminal. In B4X, include DatabaseAPI.bas in your project.
- **Errors**: Ensure XAMPP is running, api.php is in htdocs, and the database exists.
- **Security**: Use a strong API key, enable HTTPS, and restrict MySQL permissions for enhanced protection.
- **Customization**: Adjust the URL and API key to match your environment.

MagicAPI Module - New Routines  
1. InsertOrUpdateMapForColumnValue  
Description:  
  
This routine checks whether a record exists in the specified table by searching for a column value. If the record exists, it updates the record; if not, it inserts a new record.  
  
  
  
Parameters:  
  
  
  
tablename (String): The name of the table where the operation will take place.  
searchColumn (String): The column used for the search.  
searchValue (String): The value to look for in the searchColumn.  
data (Map): The data to insert or update.  
Event Triggered:  
  
<EventName>\_InsertOrUpdateMapForColumnValue(message As String, success As Boolean)  
  
  
  
message can be "Insert", "Update", or "Error".  
success indicates if the operation was successful.  
Example 1: Insert or Update a User Record  
  
  
  

```B4X
Dim userData As Map  
  
userData.Initialize  
  
userData.Put("name", "John Doe")  
  
userData.Put("email", "john.doe@example.com")  
  
userData.Put("age", 30)  
  
  
  
MagicAPI.InsertOrUpdateMapForColumnValue("users", "email", "john.doe@example.com", userData)  
  
  
  
Wait For MagicAPI_InsertOrUpdateMapForColumnValue(message As String, success As Boolean)  
  
  
  
If success Then  
  
Select Case message  
  
Case "Insert" Log("A new user record was inserted.")  
  
Case "Update" Log("The existing user record was updated.")  
  
End Select  
  
Else Log("Error: Unable to perform the operation.")  
  
End If
```

  
  
  
  
Example 2: Insert or Update a Product Record  
  
  
  

```B4X
Dim productData As Map  
  
productData.Initialize  
  
productData.Put("name", "Wireless Mouse")  
  
productData.Put("price", 29.99)  
  
productData.Put("stock", 100)  
  
  
  
MagicAPI.InsertOrUpdateMapForColumnValue("products", "name", "Wireless Mouse", productData)  
  
  
  
Wait For MagicAPI_InsertOrUpdateMapForColumnValue(message As String, success As Boolean)  
  
  
  
If success Then  
  
Select Case message  
  
Case "Insert"  
  
Log("A new product record was inserted.")  
  
Case "Update"  
  
Log("The existing product record was updated.")  
  
End Select  
  
Else Log("Error: Unable to perform the operation.")  
  
End If
```

  
  
  
  
2. InsertMultipleMaps  
Description:  
  
This routine inserts multiple records into the specified table using a list of maps, where each map represents a record.  
  
  
  
Parameters:  
  
  
  
ListOfMaps (List): A list of maps containing the data to insert. Each map represents one record.  
TableName (String): The name of the table where the records will be inserted.  
Event Triggered:  
  
<EventName>\_Insertmaps(m As Map, success As Boolean)  
  
  
  
m: The map representing the data that was inserted.  
success: Indicates if the operation was successful.  
Example 1: Insert Multiple User Records  
  
  
  

```B4X
Dim userRecords As List  
  
userRecords.Initialize  
  
  
  
Dim user1 As Map  
  
user1.Initialize  
  
user1.Put("name", "Alice")  
  
user1.Put("email", "alice@example.com")  
  
user1.Put("age", 25)  
  
  
  
Dim user2 As Map  
  
user2.Initialize  
  
user2.Put("name", "Bob")  
  
user2.Put("email", "bob@example.com")  
  
user2.Put("age", 28)  
  
  
  
userRecords.AddAll(Array(user1, user2))  
  
  
  
MagicAPI.InsertMultipleMaps(userRecords, "users")  
  
  
  
Wait For MagicAPI_Insertmaps(m As Map, success As Boolean)  
  
  
  
If success Then  
  
Log($"Record inserted: ${m}"$)  
  
Else Log("Error inserting record.")  
  
End If
```

  
  
  
  
Example 2: Insert Multiple Product Records  
  
  
  

```B4X
Dim productRecords As List  
  
productRecords.Initialize  
  
  
  
Dim product1 As Map  
  
product1.Initialize  
  
product1.Put("name", "Keyboard")  
  
product1.Put("price", 49.99)  
  
product1.Put("stock", 50)  
  
  
  
Dim product2 As Map  
  
product2.Initialize  
  
product2.Put("name", "Monitor")  
  
product2.Put("price", 199.99)  
  
product2.Put("stock", 20)  
  
  
  
productRecords.AddAll(Array(product1, product2))  
  
  
  
MagicAPI.InsertMultipleMaps(productRecords, "products")  
  
  
  
Wait For MagicAPI_Insertmaps(m As Map, success As Boolean)  
  
  
  
If success Then  
  
Log($"Record inserted: ${m}"$)  
  
Else  
  
Log("Error inserting record.")  
  
End If
```

  
  
  
  
Notes  
Both routines provide asynchronous operations, and results are returned via their respective events.  
Error handling is embedded, and failed operations trigger the appropriate event with a success = False.  
Ensure the data maps are properly initialized and contain valid column names and values for the target table.  
  
  
**[SIZE=6]MagicApi library[/SIZE]**  
# B4X Library Documentation  
  
**## Description**  
This library provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an API. It is designed to interact with an API that uses JSON as the data exchange format.  
  
**## Installation**  
1. Download the **MagicApi.b4xlib** library file.  
2. Copy the **MagicApi.b4xlib** file to the additional libraries folder in your B4X development environment.  
  
**## Initialization**  
Before using the library methods, you need to initialize it by calling the `Initialize` method and providing the following parameters:  
- `CallbackModule` (Object): the name of the callback module where the events handling API responses are located.  
- `cEventname` (String): the base name for the response events.  
- `urlbase` (String): the base URL of the API.  
- `api\_key` (String): The api key defined in the php file.  
  
**## Events**  
The library generates response events for each CRUD operation. These events should be implemented in the specified callback module during initialization.  
  
**### Generated Events**  
- `EventName\_Insertmaps(m As Map, success As Boolean)`  
- `EventName\_Delete(tablename As String, success As Boolean)`  
- `EventName\_DeleteByColumn(tablename As String, success As Boolean)`  
- `EventName\_Update(tablename As String, success As Boolean)`  
- `EventName\_UpdateByColumn(tablename As String, success As Boolean)`  
- `EventName\_SearchforId(m As Map, success As Boolean)`

[HEADING=2]**Notes**[/HEADING]  

- Both routines provide asynchronous operations, and results are returned via their respective events.
- Error handling is embedded, and failed operations trigger the appropriate event with a success = False.
- Ensure the data maps are properly initialized and contain valid column names and values for the target table.

[HEADING=2]üìÇ **Important Update for Magic API File Management** üöÄ[/HEADING]  
We‚Äôre introducing an **enhanced file and folder management system** with the latest version of Magic API! Here's how it works:  
  

---

  
[HEADING=2]**File and Folder Operations in Magic API**[/HEADING]  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Default Folder: upload**  
  

- All files and folders you create or interact with will be managed inside a new folder named **upload**.
- This folder will be **automatically created** the first time you upload a file.

üìç **Location**: The upload folder will be created in the same directory as the files.php script on your server.  
  

---

  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Automatic Folder Creation**  
  

- When you add a file to a specific folder, Magic API will **automatically create the folder** if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.
- This ensures seamless operations, eliminating the need for manual folder setup.

---

  
[HEADING=2]**Examples**[/HEADING]  
[HEADING=3]**Uploading a File to the Default Folder**[/HEADING]  
When uploading a file without specifying a folder, it will be stored directly in the **upload** folder.  
  

```B4X
MagicFiles.UploadFile(File.DirRootExternal, "example.txt")  
  
Wait For MagicFiles_UploadResult(Success As Boolean, FileName As String)  
  
If Success Then  
Log($"File ${FileName} uploaded successfully to the 'upload' folder."$)  
Else  
Log("Error uploading the file.")  
End If
```

  
  

---

  
[HEADING=3]**Uploading a File to a Specific Folder**[/HEADING]  
If you specify a folder, Magic API will automatically create it if it doesn‚Äôt exist.  
  

```B4X
MagicFiles.UploadFileToFolder(File.DirRootExternal, "document.pdf", "tasks", "report.pdf")  
  
Wait For MagicFiles_UploadToFolderResult(Success As Boolean, FileName As String)  
  
If Success Then  
Log($"File ${FileName} uploaded successfully to the 'tasks' folder."$)  
Else  
Log("Error uploading the file.")  
End If
```

  
  

---

  
[HEADING=2]**Why This Update?**[/HEADING]  
‚úÖ **Automated Management**: No need to manually create folders. Magic API does it for you!  
‚úÖ **Simplified Operations**: Focus on your app logic while the API handles the backend file structure.  
‚úÖ **Consistency**: All file operations are neatly organized within the upload folder.  
  

---

  
[HEADING=2]**Note**[/HEADING]  

- All file and folder operations (e.g., uploading, deleting, listing) will now occur inside the **upload** folder for better organization and security.
- If you interact with a folder that doesn‚Äôt exist, it will be created automatically.
