Hello,  
I managed to get the current play title a webradio using the PndAudioExoPlayer1\_OnMetadata method.  
Is there a way to get the station "icon"?  
Example:![](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/attachments/158830) for 101smoothjazz.com  
  
I have no idea how other radio android apps can get them displayed in their interface  
  
Thanks  
  
Olivier
