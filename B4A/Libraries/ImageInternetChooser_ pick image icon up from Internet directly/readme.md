End-users of some apps may need to choose small icons to save it into app's database.  
But there was no tool to choose a needed icon in 2-3 taps, but the Internet is always under finger.  
It seems, now it's possible.  
  
No fully free services with API for image searching, with good big database, soâ€¦ i invented the max universal way :)  
  
I have made the class that helps  

- to search pictures by a needed URL
- choose the needed icon
- get it into your app.

Dependencies:  

- OkHTTPUtils2
- StringUtils
- WebViewExtras, WebViewExtras2, WebViewSettings
