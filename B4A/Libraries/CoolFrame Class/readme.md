Hi All,  
  
I'm on progress almost finish converting unfinished earlier project into B4XPage, in the development phase i create my own custom view for my need and think if this can be useful for other, so i share it with you.  
  
CoolFrame is not panel like which can hold other view as child, it just a view with some properties you can setup such as color and border, nothing else.  
  
This class require additional library:  
- XUI (2.00)  
- B4A - BitmapCreator (4.73)  
- B4J - jBitmapCreator (4.73)
