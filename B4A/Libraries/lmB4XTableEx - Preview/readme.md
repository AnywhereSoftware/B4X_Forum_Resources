**UPDATE**. Ready: <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-lmb4xtableext.158817/>

I can't resist! :)  
  
I am pleased (not happy ? ) to preview one of my libraries (B4XLib, therefore **with source code**) which adds some useful functionality to B4XTable.  
  
1 - Automatic creation of columns based on a database table (SQLite)  
  
2 - **Filtering similar to Excel** (unlike Excel, you can decide whether the average (Avg) should be calculated on all records or only on those displayed (already filtered based on other fields!!!)  
  
3 - Export to Excel / CVS  
  
4 - Columns width set automatically  
  
5 - I've already forgotten what else it does?:confused:  
  
Although it may not seem like it, it required quite a bit of work (in fact it isn't finished yet), so I think it won't be free.

Note: Anyone who copies this idea will certainly be killed! ?

I think I can ask you for a donation of at least €7.5, considering the time I've invested, and you will also have the source code; what do you think?
