Not all, but most of my B4A-B4J-B4R libraries are fully open-source and I will post one  
or more demo projects with inline classes you can recompile directly to a library.  
  
I will release the open-source code on B4X Forum and github repositories:  
<https://github.com/maxmeli123>  
  
Currently I not yet developed B4R libraries, I tried to port some my ESP C++ libraries but I had difficulties to adapt to B4R.  
I plain to do it in future, time permitting. I do not use B4i but most of open-source code is easly adaptable to it.  
  
Because I don't like put my name prefix in library names, most or my libraries are just  
prefixed with( j) for B4J, (r) for B4R and without prefix for B4A, the standard way.  
Other libraries I just prefix with (Class) but are full libraries eg. ClassSlider, ClassMixer etc…  
In any case you never find MM to prefix libraries with my name. I think all peoples should do the same, IMHO is really  
annoying search libraries in the library tab prefixed in alphabetical order not by library, but by author…. a very very bad idea…
