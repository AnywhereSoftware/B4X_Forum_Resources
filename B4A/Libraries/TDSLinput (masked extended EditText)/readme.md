*TDSLinput* stands for *TechDoc Single Line input*. It is a Custom View (XUI) for the use with Anywhere B4A Suite. The view is usable by the Designer Tool of the suite or by code. The view is developed in B4A Language and compiled to a B4A Library (JAR/XML) to be used as external and additional library for the suite. *TDSLinput* creates a flexible single line input form. The form structure is based on an individual or a predefined Mask. On the screen it looks like a formatted *EditText* View with special features.

Simple, the exisiting one in the Forum do not meet my requests. **At present TDSLinput is in early access** because I please you to help me to test it. Feel free to send whises and comments.
