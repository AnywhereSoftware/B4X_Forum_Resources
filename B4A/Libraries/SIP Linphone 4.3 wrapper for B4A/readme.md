Hello everyone   
  
I present you the SIP Linphone library wrapper   
This is an implementation of a fairly old version of Linphone 4.3   
Almost all classes and methods that are present in Linphone are implemented   
I will be glad if someone tests it This is my first library for B4A, besides,   
I am not a professional programmer and I started working with Java not so long ago,   
but I will gladly accept comments on possible errors and will try to fix them.   
  
The archive with the library and an example of use are attached   
  
I spent quite a lot of time, so if someone wants to thank me, I will not refuse
