**NOTE:**  
  
This library is **not free**, because, it took a lot of time and gray hair to create all the methods and learn how the api works.  
Please **write GSheets or GSheetplus** in the order description, thanks.  
  
  
  
Thanks for your understanding. :)  
  
This library depends the Google OAuth2 class:  
<https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/class-b4x-google-oauth2.79426/>  
follow the tutorial in this topic to create your project in google console developer, enable google dive and google sheets apis, make sure to add your package name to your project, and create an oauth screen.  
  
Add this in your manifest:  
  

```B4X
AddActivityText(Main,  
  <intent-filter>  
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />  
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />  
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />  
  <data android:scheme="$PACKAGE$" />  
  </intent-filter>  
   )
```

  
  
Read example for v4 api:  

```B4X
Sub GetSheet  
table1.ClearAll  
    Dim j As HttpJob  
    j.Initialize("", Me)  
    j.Download("https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/17YACjfqxKHDCXM_N7Jnq9BC_KzzkEgXLKzHDwaIM5Zs/values/Example!A2:Z?key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")  
    Wait For (j) JobDone(j As HttpJob)  
    If j.Success Then  
        Dim parser As JSONParser  
        parser.Initialize(j.GetString.Trim)  
        Dim root As Map = parser.NextObject  
        'Dim majorDimension As String = root.Get("majorDimension")  
        Dim values As List = root.Get("values")  
   
        For Each colvalues As List In values  
   
  Dim id1 As Int = colvalues.Get("4")  
            Dim create As String = colvalues.Get("3")  
            Dim Telephone1 As Int = colvalues.Get("0")  
            Dim Age1 As Int = colvalues.Get("2")  
            Dim Name1 As String = colvalues.Get("1")  
            If colvalues.Size > 0 Then  
             table1.AddRow(Array As String(id1,Telephone1,Name1,Age1,create))  
            End If  
   
        Next  
        Dim range As String = root.Get("range")  
        Log(range)  
    End If  
  
   
  
    j.Release  
End Sub
```

  
  
Read example with Gsheets  

```B4X
Sub GetSheet  
  
   
    Table1..ClearAll  
    s.GetSheet(Me)  
    Wait For get_result(x As List)  
   
    For Each col As Map In x  
   
        Table1.AddRow(Array As String(col.Get("1"),col.Get("Téléphone"),col.Get("Name"),col.Get("Age"),col.Get("created")))  
   
    Next  
   
End Sub
```

  
  
Example connect:  
  

```B4X
#Region  Activity Attributes  
    #FullScreen: false  
    #IncludeTitle: FALSE  
#End Region  
  
Sub Process_Globals  
    'These global variables will be declared once when the application starts.  
    'These variables can be accessed from all modules.  
  
End Sub  
  
Sub Globals  
    'These global variables will be redeclared each time the activity is created.  
    'These variables can only be accessed from this module.  
  
    Dim s As GSheets  
    Private conect1 As Button  
End Sub  
  
Sub Activity_Create(FirstTime As Boolean)  
    'Do not forget to load the layout file created with the visual designer. For example:  
    s.Initialize("xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com")'your Clientid google developers console, activate google drive api and google sheets api  
    s.Sheets_name = "Example"  
    s.SpreadsheetsId = "1FHx-a_a4afTQ3L5hXJIOttCVaJNngO3113E-qqFOjbk"  
    Activity.LoadLayout("sheets1")  
   
End Sub  
  
'Connect  
Sub connect1_Click  
    s.connect  
End Sub  
  
Sub Activity_Resume  
  
s.oauth2.CallFromResume(Activity.GetStartingIntent)  
   
End Sub
```
