[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/160495/)

This is a B4A Library which uses the Bosch MT-Protocol to read Measurements from Bosch Rangefinders using Bluetooth/BLE.  
![](https://snapshots.basic4android.de/firefox_jxKwZ9fDUb.png)  
  
The Library should work with these Devices:  
  

```B4X
 static {  
        GLM_100_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72Y00", "Bosch GLM 100-25 C");  
        GLM_100_DEV_TYPES.put("00Y27K1063", "Bosch GLM 100-25 C");  
        GLM_100_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72Y50", "Bosch GLM 100-25 C");  
        GLM_100_DEV_TYPES.put("05Y27K1063", "Bosch GLM 100-25 C");  
        GLM_100_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72YK0", "Bosch GLM 100-25 C");  
        GLM_100_DEV_TYPES.put("0KY27K1063", "Bosch GLM 100-25 C");  
    }  
  
    /**  
     * Static map for GLM 50-2 family devices. Bare tool number is key. Device name is value.  
     */  
    public static final Map<String, String> GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES = new HashMap<>();  
    static {  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72T00", "Bosch GLM50-27 C");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("00T27K1063", "Bosch GLM50-27 C");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72U00", "Bosch GLM50-27 CG");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("00U27K1063", "Bosch GLM50-27 CG");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72T10", "Bosch Blaze165-27C");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("01T27K1063", "Bosch Blaze165-27C");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72U10", "Bosch Blaze165-27CG");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("01U27K1063", "Bosch Blaze165-27CG");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72UK0", "Bosch GLM50-27 CG AP");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("0KU27K1063", "Bosch GLM50-27 CG AP");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("3601K72U50", "Bosch GLM50-27 CG JP");  
        GLM_50_2_DEV_TYPES.put("05U27K1063", "Bosch GLM50-27 CG JP");  
    }
```

  
  
The Library is given to the community by [USER=78150]@Wolli013[/USER] who paid the developement and give it for FREE to any registered B4X Member. Thank you Wolli!
