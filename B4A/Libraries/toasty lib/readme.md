I want to share my first b4a lib.This is from github:<https://github.com/GrenderG/Toasty>  
and i have made some changes.  
  
how to use:  
1. copy all the addRes folders to your project folder,and add #AdditionalRes:addRes-path in your project,like this:#AdditionalRes:..\addRes  
2. copy the lib files to B4A Libraries.  
3. there are five types toasty:success,error,info,warning,normal.  
4. there is libtoastyconfig classï¼Œyou can change some parameters,and then apply.  
  
Have fun.
