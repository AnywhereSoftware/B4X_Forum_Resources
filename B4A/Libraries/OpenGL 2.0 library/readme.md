Android 2.2 and later support OpenGL 2.0 ES as well as OpenGL 1.0 ES. Having produced an OpenGL library for 1.0 I thought I may as well do one for 2.0 as well so here it is!  
  
The included "demo" is not really a demo at all and does little more than test the device OpenGL capability and initialise a drawing surface. It needs someone more interested in graphics than I to take it further.  
  
Note that the demo needs my [Threading library](http://www.b4x.com/forum/additional-libraries-official-updates/6775-threading-library.html#post39301).  
  
EDIT:- Version 1.1 posted. See post #12 for details.  
  
EDIT:- Version 1.2 posted. See post #16 for details.  
  
EDIT:- Version 1.3 posted. See post #35 for details.  
  
EDIT:- Version 1.4 posted. See post #61 for details.  
  
EDIT:- Version 1.5 posted. See post #83 for details.  
User [USER=13521]@walterf25[/USER] has added two methods to the the library to create version 1.5. The new jar and xml are posted below in OpenGL2\_v1.5\_lib.zip. I have left version 1.4 as the zip for that contains a somewhat trivial demo program. Just use the new v1.5 libs and ignore the v1.4 ones.
