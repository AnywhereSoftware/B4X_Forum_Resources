DXF is a text-based standard for CAD file exchange, featuring a well-organized format that's programmer-friendly.I've created this class for basic DXF file generation in my application. Currently it supports just three drawing methods: AddCircle, AddPolyline, and AddLine. Sample usage is provided within the class.This is just a simple and incomplete class that I throw at the bricks.
