Hi everyone  
  
I add a simple example of a horizontal slider of images, it is very easy to use, and to modify according to the need of each one.  
  
Libraries are necessary:  
-OkHttpUtils2  
-PreoptimizedCLV  
-xCustomListView  
-XUI  
-XUI Views  
  
The intent of this example is just to test how it works by loading external images and positioning them inside an xCustomListView with PreoptimizedCLV, and it works great.  
  
Thanks to all who make these great Classes / Libraries possible :) especially Erel  
  
Greetings to all
