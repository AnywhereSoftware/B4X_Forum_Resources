BasicIDE version 5.2 has a new syntax highlighting editor that also has runtime error indication and autocompletion for both B4ASript intrinsic keywords and the additional functions added by the BasicIDE project Script module. You need the new CodeEditorView library in AdditionalLibraries3.zip, other libraries are the same as for version 5.0.
