? Hi guys .  
Alimo-BaseDialoge Library released.  
This library creates a simple dialog for you to which you can add the desired view in any size, and also by changing the margins around it, the location of your dialoge.  
? Why should we use this library?  
? With this library, you can create any dialoge model you like with any width, height And movement.
