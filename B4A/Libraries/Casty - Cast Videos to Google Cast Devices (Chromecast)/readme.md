Setup:  
- Make your App AppCompat-Compatible. It is mandatory as you need to use the Appcompat Menu creationâ€¦  

```B4X
Sub Activity_CreateMenu(Menu As ACMenu)  
    Menu.Clear  
    cast.addMediaRouteMenuItem(Menu)  
    Menu.Add(2, 4, "Overflow2", Null)  
    Menu.Add(3, 5, "Overflow3", Null)  
End Sub
```

  
and  

```B4X
#If Java  
public boolean _onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu menu) {  
    if (processBA.subExists("activity_createmenu")) {  
        processBA.raiseEvent2(null, true, "activity_createmenu", false, new de.amberhome.objects.appcompat.ACMenuWrapper(menu));  
        return true;  
    }  
    else  
        return false;  
}  
#End If
```

  
  
- Add the following to your main module  

```B4X
#Extends: android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity  
#AdditionalJar: com.google.android.gms:play-services-cast-framework  
#AdditionalJar: casty.aar
```

  
  
Add the following code to your Manifest  

```B4X
SetApplicationAttribute(android:theme, "@style/MyAppTheme")  
  
CreateResource(values, theme.xml,  
<resources>  
    <style name="MyAppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">  
        <item name="colorPrimary">#0098FF</item>  
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">#007CF5</item>  
        <item name="colorAccent">#AAAA00</item>  
        <item name="windowNoTitle">true</item>  
        <item name="windowActionBar">false</item>  
    </style>  
</resources>  
)  
AddApplicationText(  
<meta-data android:value="" android:name="app_id"></meta-data>  
)  
AddApplicationText(  
<activity  
  android:name="pl.droidsonroids.casty.ExpandedControlsActivity"  
  android:theme="@style/MyAppTheme" />  
<meta-data  
  android:name="com.google.android.gms.cast.framework.OPTIONS_PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME"  
  android:value="de.donmanfred.CastOptionsProvider" />  
<receiver android:name="com.google.android.gms.cast.framework.media.MediaIntentReceiver" />  
  
<service android:name="com.google.android.gms.cast.framework.media.MediaNotificationService" />  
<service android:name="com.google.android.gms.cast.framework.ReconnectionService" />  
)  
CreateResourceFromFile(Macro, FirebaseAnalytics.GooglePlayBase)
```

  
  
Note that the line
> <meta-data android:value="" android:name="app\_id"></meta-data>

**can** be used to define YOUR App-ID though it is not needed. If the String is an Empty string then the default Receiverapp will do the Job.  
  
Update Jan 2020:  
It is mandatory to use your own app\_id which must be registered at the Google Cast Developer console.  
<https://cast.google.com/publish/#/overview>  
  
<https://support.google.com/cast-developer/answer/4512496?hl=en>  
  
[SIZE=6]**Before you begin**[/SIZE]  
  
There is a **one-time, non-refundable $5 registration fee** charged for a Google Cast Developer account. Google charge this fee to encourage higher quality applications utilizing Google Cast.  
  
  
  
You can see the Example on how to use everything.  
  
In short you can say that you can start Playing Videos when you successfully connected to the Cast device and a Session is opened.  
  

```B4X
Sub Casty_onConnected()  
    Log($"Casty_onConnected()"$)  
    Dim mb As MediaDataBuilder  
    mb.Initialize("","http://distribution.bbb3d.renderfarming.net/video/mp4/bbb_sunflower_1080p_30fps_normal.mp4").setAutoPlay(True).setContentType("videos/mp4").setMediaType(1).setStreamType(1).setTitle("DonManfred presents").setSubtitle("B4A Casting Video").addPhotoUrl("https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/bbb-splash.png?x11217")  
  
    cast.loadMediaAndPlayInBackground(mb.build)  
End Sub
```
