This Template is based on the Template *lmB4XDateTemplate* from (C) **lucasMS** ([Forum Page](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-lmb4xdatetemplate.164207/#content)). I applied some more functions.  
This Template may be used with **B4XDialog.showTemplate**. Find instrutions as comment in the example project.  
  
**Modifications/Enhancement:**  

- Added a Time pane to select a time.
- Added custom properties to get/set/show/hide Time or get/set/remove Date Markers.
- Added KeyValue storage to store the Markers.
- Added different color for work days and weekend days.
- Added Ok Button at the lower right time pane corner to return only selected time without zhe need do select a date.

In the Dialog result you may return the selected values by use the properties **getDate** / **getTime** / **getMarker**.
