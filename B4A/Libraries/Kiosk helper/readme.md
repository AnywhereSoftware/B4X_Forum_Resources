Hello.  
  
Work in progress and some help need.  
  
Really simple lib to help in kiosk apps. Sole purpose : disable the statusbar on top (which is impossible to doâ€¦). So, try to hide it really fast when the user drags it down.  
Had a report of not working, but on my two devices, it seems to do it's job, so testers needed.  
  
Sample project and lib attached, and comments welcomed.
