After 2 days research about ActivityResultContracts and PickVisualMedia in Android 13, i wrote this inline Java for my use and share it for all member B4A too, hope you will like and use this my code in many apps!  
  
This inline java code allows you to choose photo/video or documents file support from Android 4.4 to 13 without any permissions. Especially support new photo picker interface on Android 13.

A special feature is backward compatibility with older Android OS, support to select one or more files at the same time, this also help you can get filename from this selector and can copy it to your app to use.
