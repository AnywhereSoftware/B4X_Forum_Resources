[HEADING=1]ProgressDialogPlus â€“ Native Android ProgressDialog Wrapper (Spinner + Horizontal)[/HEADING]  
![](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/attachments/164530)  
  
Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹  
  
because i needed the ability to update the text inside the B4A ProgressDialog without flickering (wich isnt possible), ive created a lightweight yet powerful wrapper for the native Android ProgressDialog using JavaObject wich supports the standard Spinner and the Progressbar..
