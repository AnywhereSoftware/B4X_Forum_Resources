### How can I edit an uncompressed b4xlib ? by Colly

I need to make some changes to a library, specifically "B4XOpenMap.b4xlib."  
  
I changed the extension to .zip, then uncompressed it with 7zip, this resulted in one folder named files (with some image files in it ) and four files, three with a .bas extension and a manifest.txt file.  
  
 How do I edit these files ?, so far the only thing I've been able to do is to edit them in notepad++ .  
  
I hoped I would be able to edit them in the IDE, but all i can open is .b4a (source files) files.  
  
I'm new to b4a and have scoured the forum for hours but all i have seen is "edit the files", but not how to edit them (apologies if i've been dumb and missed the obvious).
