Grid using Erel sample code based on PreoptimizedCLV -> <https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/grid-class-preoptimizedclv.116309/#post-726808>

The idea of this class is to be able to load in a 3 column Grid (customizable) a long list of url images, and to be able to customize all the labels panels etcâ€¦  
  
This class is based on the code:

It works quite well, but when you do the VisibleRangeChanged it loads the images, and this process takes longer than I would like. I have not managed to refine it more. I invite anyone who can think of ideas and modifications to improve this grid.  
  
I hope someone is encouraged to improve it and to have a Grid Class that works smoothly, and that can be customized.
