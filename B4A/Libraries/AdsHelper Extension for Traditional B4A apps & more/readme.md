[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/131798/)

I wanted to share an update I made to the [AdsHelper class](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/adshelper-extends-firebaseadmob2-google-mobile-ads-v20-0.129696/) and example.  
  
Added:  

- support for rewarded video ads
- events for rewarded video
- events for [rewarded interstitial](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/adshelper-extends-firebaseadmob2-google-mobile-ads-v20-0.129696/post-815445)
- events for open ads
- added parameter for open ads for setting the background delay before allowing the ad to show
- incorporated [native ad example](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4xpages-native-ads-with-mediaview-firebaseadmob2-and-mobile-ads-sdk-v20.131211/) and moved the code into a separate class
- example of a fixed size banner ad (300x250)
- support for traditional B4A apps

  
Modified:  

- code reorganized to make it more readable and easier to follow
