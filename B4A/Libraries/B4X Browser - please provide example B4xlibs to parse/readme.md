G'Day peeps.  
I'm working on adding B4xlib functionality to the B4X Browser. To do so, I need to ensure that I can parse these files as required.  
I can't find any specific documentation on what these files can/do contain, so I have to rely on examples from others.  
  
B4X Browser already handles the following when reading legacy XML files. I want to ensure that the same/equivalent functionality is provided (if possible) when reading B4xLib files.

If you know of some documentation, and/or can provide example(s) file(s), then please do so. Without your input this task will likely require multiple iterations to ensure it's correctness.  
  
Thanks in advance
