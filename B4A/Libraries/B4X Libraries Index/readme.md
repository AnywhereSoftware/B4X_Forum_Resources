[**Online Table**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qFvc3Q70RriJS3m_ywBoJvZ47gSTVAuN_X04SI0_XBw/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
Developers who want to add their libraries: click on the green button in the top right corner and request editor permissions.  
Note that the order of items in the table is not important  
  
The table is also used by the IDE to show the online version. Clicking on the blue version number will take the developer to the library thread.
