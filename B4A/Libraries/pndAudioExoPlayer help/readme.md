Hello,  
I installed the **pndAudioExoPlayer** library ([here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/pndaudioexoplayer-for-online-radio-stations-apps.139173/)) and downloaded the example provided.   
On my Android 10 smartphone, no "Album art" is displayed. How to do this?  
(I assume I should add an ImageView in the designer and some code behind?)  
  
Thanks for the help
