🔐 TOOL released: **SqlCipherConverter v1.0 – Simplifying SQLite to SQLCipher Migration!**  
  
  
A common challenge when moving an existing SQLite database to SQLCipher is that encryption can only be applied to a new database. This makes migrating existing data challenging without specialized tools.  
  
To address this, I’ve developed a Python-based open source utility that simplifies the migration process. The tool allows you to:  
  

- Select an existing SQLite database
- Choose specific tables (or all tables) to migrate using a simple GUI
- Encrypt and export them into a SQLCipher database — just select and click export, enter a password, select output filename, and it’s done

  
The tool is built for ease of use during the transition from unencrypted to encrypted databases.
