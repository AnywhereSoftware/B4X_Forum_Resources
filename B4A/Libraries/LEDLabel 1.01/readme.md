This is my first attempt to create a library Please be kind :)  
  
This allows you to make a label with tiny indicator on left which can be turned on or off (with any choice of color)  
  
Usage instructions:  
- Download the ledlabel.jar & xml and put it in the B4X additional library folder  
- Add reference to LEDLabel  
- Add LEDLabel with the designer.
