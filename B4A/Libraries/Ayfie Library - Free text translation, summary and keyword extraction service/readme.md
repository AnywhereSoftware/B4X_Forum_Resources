With our Entity Extractor you can fast and easy find entities such as date, location, organization, and named persons. Entities are also often used as input data for other features such as query completion and “did you mean” spell checking.

[HEADING=3]**Abstractive Summarization**[/HEADING]  
Get the important facts and ideas highlighted in an executive summary by our Summarizer.  
  
We have trained the Summarizer on a significant volume of news articles and it's an English-speaking bleeding edge tech solution. Summarizing language models come in two varieties: extractive and abstractive. Our main model is abstractive, meaning that it can write new sentences in addition to extracting the most relevant ones from the text.
