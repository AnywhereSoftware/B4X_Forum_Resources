SunCalc is a tiny BSD-licensed library originally written in JavaScript for calculating sun position, sunlight phases (times for sunrise, sunset, dusk, etc.), moon position and lunar phase for the given location and time, created by Vladimir Agafonkin (@mourner) as a part of the SunCalc.net project. This is my conversion to B4X of that project. Please see spoiler for license
