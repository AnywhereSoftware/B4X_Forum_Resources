I usually end up accumulating loads of files in downloads which are a mix of zips, code, images, libraries etc.  
I created this tool to quickly organize my files / lists. I hope my fellow programmers will find it useful.

[HEADING=2]Why You Need SortAnything[/HEADING]  

- **Cluttered folders slowing you down?** If you’ve ever stared at a messy folder full of downloads, documents, or images, paralyzed by the thought of sorting it all, SortAnything simplifies the process. **Just select your files, set up your categories, and start sorting**—file by file, as fast as you can decide.
- **Ever wanted to assign files to folders just by pressing a key?** With SortAnything, you can. Instead of dragging and dropping, **assign files on the fly with hotkeys or simple buttons**. Save time, reduce mistakes, and keep your focus on the content.
- **Need previews for images and text files before you sort?** See what you’re moving before you move it. **Never accidentally shuffle the wrong file** into the wrong place again.
- **Want to pick up where you left off?** Life happens. With **session management**, you can save your progress and return later—no need to start over from scratch.
- **Prefer to export your sorted list instead of moving actual files?** Get your organized list as JSON, CSV, TXT, or HTML—perfect for reports, analysis, or sharing.

[HEADING=2]How It Works[/HEADING]  

- **Choose Your Files:** Select from a folder, clipboard, CSV, or text file.
- **Set Up Your Categories:** Create up to 10 personalized buckets (categories) with unique names and colors. Make them fit your workflow.
- **Sort Fast:** Files appear one by one. Assign each to a category with a single key press or click.
- **Preview and Confirm:** See images and text file previews before you move anything.
- **Finish Your Way:** Move files to folders, or export your sorted list for other uses.
- **Save Your Progress:** Stop and restart your session anytime—no lost work, no hassle.
