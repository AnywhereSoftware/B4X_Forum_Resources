**A new** [B4X FFT library](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/b4x-fft-class.78797/#content) **does exits, the library in this thread is only valid for B4A.**  
  
The ownership of this post has been changed by Erel from agraham to klaus, with agrahams agreement, to allow me to edit this post with the update of the FFT library.  
  
agrahams original text.  
*About nine months ago Klaus and I collaborated on a Basic4ppc library and demonstration program to perform forward and inverse Fast Fourier Transforms.  
  
We have collaborated once again to port the library and demo to Basic4android.*  
  
Update 2014.08.03  
The library has been updated after the bug report [here](http://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/problem-with-fft-transform2.42910/#content).  
The demo program has been 'rewritten' to take advantage of the B4A improvements since december 2010.
