Hi,  
  
This is my first experiment with glassmorphism.  
The class “fsGlassmorphism.bas” can be used to create a view with a blurred background and works with B4a and B4i.  
The test project can be run with B4a and B4i.  
  
Anyone can expand and improve the project as they wish.  
The expansions or improvements can, of course, be posted here.
