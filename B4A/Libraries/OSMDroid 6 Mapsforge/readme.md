This library is an addition to the **OSMDroid 6** library and enables the display of **Mapsforge offline maps** in the **OSMDroid6 MapView**. **Mapsforge** maps are vector maps, which allows the size of the map file to be several tens of times smaller.  
  
**Mapsforge** maps can be downloaded from this [link](https://download.mapsforge.org/maps/), which contains maps of a large number of countries. It is also possible to create maps of the desired areas via this [link](https://extract.bbbike.org/?format=mapsforge-osm.zip).  
  
This library is dependent on the parent **OSMDroid 6** library and cannot be used separately. You can download the **OSMDroid 6** library from this [link](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/osmdroid-6.147200/).
