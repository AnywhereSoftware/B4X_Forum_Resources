Hi **All**,  
  
Some of you will remember ***[db2000 functions library](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/db2000-functions-library.2875/)*** for **B4PPC**, certainly the older forum members will remember… well, a few years ago I realized a version for **Java** and subsequently for **B4A** and **B4J**… after removing some classes and methods that I have not considered attractive because too tied to particular projects, I decided to make available to an adapted version of the library… thus were born ***db2000.J.eXtrafunctions***, ***db2000.B4A.eXtrafunctions*** and ***db2000.B4J.eXtrafunctions***! :)  
  
In this library there are also classes and methods already seen in libraries of other authors (but not for this are copies!), there are methods apparently redundant as those in classes fDATE and fDATESTRING… other methods may seem unnecessary because they are already embedded in **B4A** and **B4J** but as I wrote earlier are "things" that come from far away (the library was initially created for **Java**), anyway I used the library and its methods with great satisfaction also in recent projects!… however, although there are many methods, the library remains under 52Kb!  
  
The library in its versions (**J** (**Java**), **B4A** and **B4J**) is provided as is, without warranty, so the author (me ;)) disclaims any responsibility!  
  
A summary of the documentation of the classes and methods of ***db2000.J.eXtrafunctions*** can be reached [***here***](https://www.db2000web.net/db2000%20eXperiences/documents/Java/db2000.J.eXtrafunctions/index.html)… from links below the adapted versions of the library for **Java**, **B4A** and **B4J**…  
  
Best Regards to All,
