### Spinner Wheel - Vertical and Horizontal (24 June: new lib files in post #47) by Johan Schoeman
### 12/10/2019
[B4X Forum - B4A - Libraries](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/62723/)

It wraps the Vertical Spinner Wheel part of [this Github project](https://github.com/ai212983/android-spinnerwheel). Spin the wheel with a finger - up or down. The spinner is cyclic i.e it acts like a circular buffer.  
  
Posting:  
1. B4A project demonstrating the use of the Vertical Spinner Wheel - b4aAndroidSpinnerWheel.zip  
2. Zipped files with the required library files (including nineoldandroids) - copy them to your additional library folder. Library files are in AndroidSpinnerWheel.zip  
  
Please note: have added no code in the designer or in the B4A project to position the views - just plonked down and dragged them in the designer. Leaving positioning to those making use of this project.  
  
I will add the Horizontal Spinner Wheel part of the project at some stageâ€¦
